<h2>THE BOSTON TERRIER.</h2>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>Who and what is this little dog that has forced his way by leaps
and bounds from Boston town to the uttermost parts of this grand
country, from the broad Atlantic to the Golden Gate, and from the
Canadian border to the Gulf of Mexico? Nay, not content with this,
but has overrun the imaginary borders north and south until he is
fast becoming as great a favorite on the other side as here, and
who promises in the near future, unless all signs fail, to cross
all oceans, and extend his conquests wherever man is found that can
appreciate beauty and fidelity in man&rsquo;s best friend. What
passports does he present that he should be entitled to the
recognition that he has everywhere accorded him? A dog that has in
35 years or less so thoroughly established himself in the
affections of the great body of the American people, so that his
friends offer no apology whatever in calling him the American dog,
must possess peculiar qualities that endear him to all classes and
conditions of men, and I firmly believe that when all the fads for
which his native city is so well known have died a natural death,
he will be in the early bloom of youth. Yea, in the illimitable
future, when the historian McCauley&rsquo;s New Zealander is
lamenting over the ruins of that marvelous city of London, he will
be accompanied by a Boston terrier, who will doubtless be
intelligent enough to share his grief. In reply to the query as to
who and what he is, it will be readily recalled that on the birth
of possibly the greatest poet the world has ever seen it was
stated:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&ldquo;The force of nature could no further go,</p>
<p>To make a third, she joined the other two.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>And this applies with equal force to the production of the
Boston terrier. The two old standard breeds of world-wide
reputation, the English bulldog and the bull terrier, had to be
joined to make a third which we believe to be the peer of either,
and the superior of both. The dog thus evolved possesses a type and
individuality strictly his own, inherited from both sides of the
house, and is a happy medium between these two grand breeds,
possessing the best qualities of each. To some the name
&ldquo;terrier&rdquo; would suggest the formation of the dog on
approximate terrier lines, but this is as completely erroneous as
to imagine that the dog should approach in like proportion to the
bull type. When the dog was in its infancy it was frequently called
the Boston bull, and then again the round-headed bull and terrier,
and later, when the Boston Terrier Club was taken under the wings
of the great A.K.C. in 1893, it became officially known as the
Boston terrier.</p>
<p>There are several features that are characteristic of the dog
that tend to its universal popularity&mdash;its attractive shape,
style and size, its winning disposition, and its beautiful color
and markings. From the bulldog he inherits a sweet, charming
personality, quiet, restful demeanor, and an intense love of his
master and home. He does not possess the restless, roving
disposition which characterizes so many members of the terrier
tribe, nor will he be found quarreling with other dogs. From the
bull terrier side he inherits a lively mood, the quality of taking
care of himself if attacked by another dog, and of his owner, too,
if necessary, the propensity to be a great destroyer of all kinds
of vermin if properly trained, and an ideal watch dog at night. No
wonder he is popular, he deserves to be. The standard describes him
as follows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The general appearance of the Boston terrier is that of a
smooth, short-coated, compactly built dog of medium station. The
head should indicate a high degree of intelligence and should be in
proportion to the dog&rsquo;s size; the body rather short and well
knit, the limbs strong and finely turned, no feature being so
prominent that the dog appears badly proportioned. The dog conveys
an impression of determination, strength and activity, style of a
high order and carriage easy and graceful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The men composing the Boston Terrier Club, who framed this
standard in 1900, were as thoughtful a body as could possibly be
gotten together, and they carefully considered and deliberated over
every point at issue, and in my estimation this standard is as near
perfect as any can be. I was an interested participant in the
discussion of the same, having in my mind&rsquo;s eye as models
those two noted dogs owned by that wonderful judge of the breed,
Mr. Alex. Goode, Champion Monte, and his illustrious sire, Buster.
If one takes the pains to analyze the standard he will be impressed
by the perfect co-relation of harmony of all parts of the dog, from
the tip of his broad, even muzzle, to the end of his short screw
tail. Nothing incongruous in its makeup presents itself, but a
graceful, symmetrical style characterizes the dog, and I firmly
believe that any change whatever would be a detriment.</p>

<p>Edward Burnett<br />
A Prominent Early Breeder</p>
</div>
<p>It seems to be hardly necessary at this late date to give a
history of the dog, but perhaps for that large number of people who
are intensely interested in him but have not had the chance to have
been made acquainted with his origin, a brief survey may be of
service. Although Boston rightly claims the honor of being the
birthplace of the Boston terrier, still I think the original start
of the dog was in England, for the first dog that was destined to
be the ancestor of the modern Boston terrier was a dog named Judge,
a cross between an English bull and bull terrier, imported from the
other side and owned by Mr. R. C. Hooper, and known as
Hooper&rsquo;s Judge.</p>
<p>On my last visit to England I found that quite a number of dogs
have been bred in this way, viz., a first cross between the bull
and terrier, especially in the neighborhood of Birmingham in the
middle of England; but these dogs are no more like the Boston
terrier than an ass is like a thoroughbred horse. Judge was a dark
brindle, with a white stripe in face, nearly even mouthed, weighing
about thirty-two pounds, and approximating more to the bull than
the terrier side. He was mated to a white, stocky built,
three-quarter tail, low stationed bitch, named Gyp (or Kate), owned
by Mr. Edward Burnett of Southboro. Like Judge, she possessed a
good, short, blocky head. It may not be out of place to state here
that some few years ago, on paying a visit to Mr. Burnett at
Deerfoot Farm, Southboro, he told me that in the early days he
possessed thirteen white Boston terrier dogs that used to accompany
him in his walks about the farm, and woe to any kind of vermin or
vagrant curs that showed themselves. From Judge and Gyp descended
Well&rsquo;s Eph, a low-stationed, dark brindle dog with even white
markings, weighing twenty-eight pounds. Eph was mated to a golden
brindle, short-headed, twenty pound bitch, having a three-quarter
tail, named Tobin&rsquo;s Kate. From this union came a red brindle
dog with a white blaze on one side of his face, white collar, white
chest, and white feet, weighing twenty-two pounds, and possessing
the first screw tail, named Barnard&rsquo;s Tom. I shall never
forget the first visit I made to Barnard&rsquo;s stable to see him.
To my mind he possessed a certain type, style and quality such as I
had never seen before, but which stamped him as the first real
Boston terrier, as the dog is today understood. I was never tired
of going to see him and his brother, Atkinson&rsquo;s Toby. Tom was
mated to a dark brindle bitch, evenly marked, weighing twenty
pounds. She had a good, short, blocky head, and a three-quarter
tail, and known as Kelley&rsquo;s Nell. The result of this mating
was a dog destined to make Boston terrier history, and to my mind
the most famous Boston terrier born, judged by results. He was
known as &ldquo;Mike,&rdquo; commonly called &ldquo;Barnard&rsquo;s
Mike.&rdquo; He was a rather light brindle and white, even mouthed,
short tailed dog, weighing about twenty-five pounds, very typical,
but what impressed me was his large, full eye, the first I had ever
seen, and which we see so often occurring in his descendants. I
owned a grandson of his named &ldquo;Gus,&rdquo; 48136, who was
almost a reproduction of him, with eyes fully as large.
Unfortunately he jumped out of a third-story window in my kennels
and permanently ended his usefulness. Chief among the direct
descendants from Hooper&rsquo;s Judge were the noted stud dogs, Ben
Butler, Hall&rsquo;s Max, O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s Ross, Hook&rsquo;s
Punch, Trimount King, McMullen&rsquo;s Boxer, and Ben,
Goode&rsquo;s Ned, and Bixby&rsquo;s Tony Boy. The two dogs that
impressed me the most in that group were Max, a fairly good sized,
beautiful dispositioned dog that could almost talk, belonging to
Dr. Hall, then a house doctor at the Eye and Ear Infirmary, Charles
street. He was used, I am told, a great deal in the stud, and sired
a great many more puppies than the doctor ever knew of.
Bixby&rsquo;s Tony Boy was the other. I had a very handsome bitch
by him out of a Torrey&rsquo;s Ned bitch, and liked her so much
that I offered Mr. Bixby, I believe, $700 for Tony, only to be told
that a colored gentleman (who evidently knew a good thing when he
saw it) had offered him $200 more.</p>
<p>Of the line of early bitches of the same breeding may briefly be
mentioned Reynold&rsquo;s Famous, dam of Gilbert&rsquo;s Fun;
Kelley&rsquo;s Nell, dam of Ross and Trimount King; Saunder&rsquo;s
Kate, dam of Ben Butler; Nolan&rsquo;s Mollie, dam of Doctor,
Evadne and Nancy.</p>
<p>Quite a number of other small dogs were subsequently introduced
into the breed, which had now been somewhat inbred. These were
largely imported from the other side, and were similar in type to
Hooper&rsquo;s Judge. One of the most noted was the Jack Reede dog.
He was an evenly marked, reddish brindle and white, rather rough in
coat, three-quarter tail, weighing fourteen pounds. Another very
small dog was the Perry dog, imported from Scotland, bluish and
white in color, with a three-quarter straight tail, and weighing
but six pounds. I have always felt very sorry not to have seen him,
as he must have been a curiosity. Still another outside dog, also
imported, and very quarrelsome, white in color, weighing eighteen
pounds, with a good, large skull, and an eye as full as
Barnard&rsquo;s Mike, but straight tail, was Kelley&rsquo;s Brick.
Another outside dog (I do not know where he came from), was
O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s Ben. He was a short, cobby, white and tan
brindle color, three-quarter tail, with a short head and even
mouth. It will be observed that practically all these outside dogs
were small sized, and were selected largely on that account. By the
continued inbreeding of the most typical of the sons and daughters
of Tom, the present type of the dog was made permanent.</p>

</div>
<p>Perhaps this somewhat restricted review of the breed, going back
over thirty-six or seven years and showing the somewhat mixed
ancestry of our present blue-blooded Boston terrier of today, may
afford some explanation of the diversity of type frequently
presented in one litter. I have seen numbers of litters where the
utmost attention has been paid to every detail with the expectancy
of getting crackerjacks, to find that one will have to wait for the
&ldquo;next time,&rdquo; as the litter in question showed the bull
type, and the terrier also, and very little Boston; but
fortunately, with the mating intelligently attended to, and the
putting aside of all dogs that do not comport to the standard as
non-breeders, a type of a dog will be bred true to our highest
ideals. My advice to all breeders is, do not get discouraged, try,
yes, try again, and Boston terriers, that gladden the eye and fill
the pocketbook, will be yours.</p>

<h2>THE BOSTON TERRIER CLUB.</h2>
<h4>ITS HISTORY, THE ORDER OF ITS BUSINESS, CONSTITUTION, BY-LAWS,
AND OFFICIAL STANDARD.</h4>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>In 1890 a club was formed in Boston by a comparatively small
body of men who were very much interested in the dog then known as
the Round-Headed Bull and Terrier dog. These men were breeders and
lovers of the dog, and their main object in coming together was not
to have a social good time (although, happily, this generally took
place), but to further the interests of the dog in every legitimate
way. The dog had been shown at the New England Kennel Club show,
held in Boston in April, 1888, being judged by Mr. J. P. Barnard,
Jr., ofttimes styled &ldquo;the father of the breed,&rdquo;
practically two years before the formation of the Club. The year
following the Club applied for admission in the American Kennel
Club, and recognition for their dogs in the Stud Book. The A. K. C.
stated that while perfectly willing to take the Club into its fold,
they could not place the dog in the Stud Book, as he was not an
established breed, and suggesting, that as the dog was not a bull
terrier, and as he was then bred exclusively in Boston, the name of
the &ldquo;Boston Terrier Club.&rdquo; The year following the A. K.
C., after a great deal of persuasion by the loyal and devoted
members of the Club, became convinced of the merits of the breed,
and formally acknowledged the same by admitting the Club to
membership, and giving their dog a place in the official Stud
Book.</p>
<p>The Boston Terrier Club is duly incorporated under the laws of
Massachusetts, has a present membership of from seventy-five to a
hundred, men and women who are devoted to the dog, and willing to
do everything for its advancement. The annual meeting is held on
the second Wednesday in December, at which a number of judges are
elected, whose names are forwarded to the bench show committees of
the principal shows, requesting that one of the number be elected
to officiate as judge of the Boston terriers. Monthly meetings are
held which are always exceedingly interesting and instructive.</p>
<p>The officers are elected by printed ballots sent to all members
of the Club, who mark and return them. They consist of the
president, vice-president, secretary, and treasurer. The executive
committee consists of the officers (ex officio) and three
others.</p>
<p>The Club gives a specialty show yearly in Boston and is the
largest and greatest of one breed fixtures; the dog being, in fact,
one of the largest supporters of the dog shows in the country. Cups
and medals are offered at most of the bench shows for competition
among the members, and at the Ladies&rsquo; Kennel Association
shows a cup and medal were offered, open to all exhibitors of
Boston terriers.</p>
<p>In view of the fact that so many Boston Terrier Clubs are
starting up all over the country, and even beyond, the following
Order of Business, Constitution, By-Laws, and Official Standard,
can safely be taken as models:</p>
<h4>ORDER OF BUSINESS.</h4>
<ol>
<li>Calling meeting to order.</li>

<h3>THE REVISED BOSTON TERRIER STANDARD</h3>
<p>The present Boston terrier standard was adopted by the Boston
Terrier Club on October 7, 1914, as a result of a revision
recommended by a committee appointed by the Boston Terrier
Club.</p>
<p>It was felt, in view of the fact that the dog had become
established all over the continent among breeders and fanciers not
as familiar with the ideal of the breed as were the original
breeders and friends of the dog around Boston, that a more
explicit, definite standard, one that could be more easily
understood by the great body of the dog&rsquo;s admirers of today,
should be adopted.</p>
<p>It will be readily observed by a comparison of the old standard,
which has practically been in existence since the formation of the
club in 1891, that no vital point has been really changed.</p>

<p>GENERAL APPEARANCE: The general appearance of the Boston terrier
should be that of a lively, highly intelligent, smooth coated,
short headed, compactly built, short tailed, well balanced dog of
medium station, of brindle color and evenly marked with white. The
head should indicate a high degree of intelligence and should be in
proportion to the size of the dog; the body rather short and well
knit, the limbs strong and neatly turned; tail short and no feature
being so prominent that the dog appears badly proportioned. The dog
should convey an impression of determination, strength and
activity, with style of a high order; carriage easy and graceful. A
proportionate combination of &ldquo;Color&rdquo; and &ldquo;Ideal
Markings&rdquo; is a particularly distinctive feature of a
representative specimen, and dogs with a preponderance of white on
body, or without the proper proportion of brindle and white on
head, should possess sufficient merit otherwise to counteract their
deficiencies in these respects.</p>
<p>The ideal &ldquo;Boston Terrier Expression&rdquo; as indicating
&ldquo;a high degree of intelligence,&rdquo; is also an important
characteristic of the breed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Color and Markings&rdquo; and &ldquo;Expression&rdquo;
should be given particular consideration in determining the
relative value of &ldquo;General Appearance&rdquo; to other

<h2>KENNELING</h2>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>It goes without saying that any place is not good enough for a
dog, although when one considers the way some dogs are housed in
small, dark outbuildings, or damp, ill-lighted and poorly
ventilated cellars, or even perhaps worse, in old barrels or
discarded drygoods boxes in some out-of-the-way corner, it is not
surprising the quality of the puppies raised in them.</p>
<p>A great many people who only keep one or two dogs keep them in
the kitchen or living room, and here, of course, conditions are all
right, but the fancier who keeps any considerable number will find
that it pays to house his dogs in a comfortable, roomy, dry
building, free from draughts, on high lands (with a gravel
foundation, if possible), that can be flooded with sunshine and
fresh air. Such a kennel can be simple or elaborate in
construction, severely plain or ornamental in its architecture, but
it must possess the above characteristics in order to have its
occupants kept in the pink of condition. Where half a dozen dogs
are kept, I think a kennel about 20 feet long, nine feet wide, with
a pitched roof, nine feet high in the front, and at the back seven
feet, with a southern exposure, with good windows that open top and
bottom, and a good tight board floor will do admirably. This can,
of course, be partitioned off in pens to suit, with convenient runs
outside wired at the top to prevent dogs jumping over. The building
should, of course, be well constructed, covered with good sheathing
paper, and either clapboarded or shingled. Such a building should
be cool in summer and warm in winter, and thoroughly weather proof.
If provided with a good &ldquo;Eureka ventilator&rdquo; and well
painted, the dogs and their owner will be satisfied. Where a much
larger number of dogs are kept, then a corresponding amount of
floor space is a necessity. I rather like the style of a kennel,
say from fifty to a hundred feet long, twelve to fifteen feet wide,
with an open compartment or shed, about twelve feet long (in which
the dogs can take a sun bath or get the air if the weather is not
favorable to go outside. This also makes an ideal feeding pen), in
the middle of the house, without outside runs to each pen, and each
run opening into a large exercising yard, so that all the dogs may
have a good frolic together, of course, under the watchful eye of
the kennel man.</p>
<p>The large breeders will also require a separate building at some
distance from the main kennels for use as a hospital, a small
kennel for his bitches in season, and some small, portable kennels
which can be placed under adequate shade trees for his litters of
puppies during the hot weather. It would be an excellent plan if
good shade trees could be planted to cover all the runs, but if
this is not possible, then it is advisable to have at the rear of
the kennels a clear space covered over with a roof, say ten or
twelve feet wide, for the dogs to have free access to during the
heat of the day.</p>
<p>Perhaps a description of our own kennels, entirely different in
construction from these, and costing more to build, may be of
interest here. We have two buildings, seventy-five feet apart,
built exactly like a house, with two stories and a high basement or
cellar, twenty-five feet wide and thirty feet long. One of these
houses is lined with matched paneling and divided off on each floor
into separate compartments; the other is only boarded, one
thickness of good paper and clapboarded and, of course, not nearly
as warm. This second building has no pens in it. The basement has a
stone wall at the back, but on the east, south and west sides is
boarded to the ground, and has a dry gravel floor. These buildings
are well supplied with windows (the same as a house), and get the
sun all day. In these buildings we have no artificial heat
whatever, and all stock, except small puppies, are kept there. Our
pups in the winter have warm quarters until they are four months
old, when they are placed in the south side of the warmer kennels.
All puppies are kept in the cool basement in the hot weather, and
during the summer our bitches in whelp are kept there also. We have
not any separate runs attached to these buildings, which entails a
much closer watch on the dogs, of course, but each building opens
into a very large enclosure with abundant shade trees, and the dogs
can, if let out, have the run of several acres.</p>
<p>In the fall of the year we have several tons of rowen (second
crop hay with a good deal of clover in it) put in the upper story
of the open kennel, and a smaller amount in the first story, and
during the winter a certain number of young dogs that will not
quarrel amongst themselves are given the run of the building where
they burrow into the soft hay and are as comfortable as can be.
Particular care has to be taken that they do not get any bones or
any food to quarrel over, or trouble would ensue right away. Allow
me to say that only dogs brought up together with perfect
dispositions can be allowed to run together. A strange dog must
never be placed with them or his days will be numbered. In the
summer, of course, no dogs are kept in the upper story, as they
would suffer from the heat. Also no bitches in whelp are ever
allowed to run together.</p>
<p>In the other kennel in each pen during the cold weather is a
large, tight box, with hole in side, filled with this soft hay,
renewed when necessary, in which two dogs sleep very comfortably.
The windows in each kennel, as soon as the weather permits, are
kept open at the top night and day, and top and bottom while the
dogs are out doors in the daytime, and in this way the kennels can
be kept perfectly sweet and sanitary. Three times during the year,
in spring, midsummer and fall, the kennels are treated with a
thorough fumigation of sulphur. We buy bar sulphur by the barrel of
a wholesale druggist or importer, and use a good quantity (a small
dose does not do much good), keeping the kennel windows and doors
tightly closed for twelve hours, after which the building is
thoroughly aired before the dogs are returned. Of course, this
would not be practical during the winter, nor is it at all
necessary. We find that once a week (except of course, during the
cold weather), it is a good plan to give the woodwork that the dog
comes in contact with a good sprinkling with a watering pot with a
solution of permanganate of potassium, using a tablespoonful of the
crystals dissolved in a quart of hot water. It costs at wholesale
fifty cents per pound, and is the best disinfectant I have ever
used. Unless the kennels are kept scrupulously clean the
dogs&rsquo; eyes, especially the puppies, are liable to become
seriously inflamed. The gravel in the basement we remove to a depth
of eight inches twice a year, putting fresh in its place. Where a
large number of dogs are kept it will be found very convenient to
have a cook house, wash room and a small closet for kennel utensils
in close proximity to the kennels.</p>
<p>By attending to these important essentials, viz., an abundance
of pure air and sunshine, protection from dampness, draughts, and
cold, proper disinfecting, and sufficient protection from the
intense heat of summer, good health, and a reasonable amount of
success can be confidently expected, but disease will surely find
an entrance where these requirements are not met.</p>
<p>I would like to add that kennels only large enough for white
mice, or perchance piebald rats, can never be successfully used to
raise Boston terriers in.</p>

<h2>GENERAL HINTS ON BREEDING.</h2>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>Having become possessed of suitable kennels to house his stock,
the breeder is confronted with the great question: How and where
shall I obtain my breeding stock? Much depends on a right start and
the getting of the proper kind of dogs for the foundation. Our
celebrated Boston poet, Oliver Wendell Holmes, when asked when a
child&rsquo;s education should begin, promptly replied, &ldquo;A
hundred years before it was born.&rdquo; This contains an inherent
truth that all breeders of choice stock of whatever description it
may be, recognize. To be well born is half the battle, and I think
this applies with particular force to the Boston terrier, for
without a good ancestry of well bred dogs, possessing the best of
dispositions, constitutions and conformity to the standard, he is
worse than useless.</p>
<p>Whether the start is made with one bitch or a dozen, I believe
the best plan to follow is to obtain of a reliable breeder, noted
for the general excellence of his dogs in all desirable
characteristics, what he considers the best stock obtainable for
breeding purposes. This does not imply, of course, that these
bitches will be candidates for bench honors, but it does mean that
if mated with suitable sires the production of good, all-round
puppies with a reasonable amount of luck will be the result. It
would be useless to attempt to deal with the subject of breeding in
more than a few of its aspects, for after a period of twenty-five
years of expended and scientific experiments in the breeding
exclusively of Bostons, I shall have to confess that there are many
problems still unsolved. The rules and regulations that govern the
production of many other breeds of dogs seem impotent here, the
assumption that &ldquo;like produces like&rdquo; does not seem to
hold good frequently in this breed, but perhaps the elements of
uncertainty give an unspeakable charm to the efforts put forth for
the production of the dogs which will be a credit to the
owner&rsquo;s kennel. The old adage that &ldquo;there is nothing
duller than a <em>puzzle</em> of which the answer is known,&rdquo;
can readily be applied here. I shall endeavor to confine my remarks
to the laws observed and the lines followed for the production of
dogs in our kennels, especially in the attainment of correct color
and markings, vigorous constitutions and desirable
dispositions.</p>
<p>In speaking of the breeding stock I am aware that I am going
contrary to the opinion of many breeders when I state that I
believe that the dam should possess equal or more quality than the
sire, that her influence and characteristics are perpetuated in her
posterity to a greater degree than are those of the sire&rsquo;s,
especially that feature of paramount importance, a beautiful
disposition, hence I speak of the maternal side of the house first.
There are two inexorable laws that confront the breeder at the
onset, more rigid than were those of the Medes and Persians, the
non-observance of which will inevitably lead to shipwreck. Better
by far turn one&rsquo;s energies in attempting to square the
circle, or produce a strain of frogs covered with feathers, than
attempt to raise Boston terriers without due attention being given
to those physiological laws which experience has proven correct.
The first law is that &ldquo;Like produces like,&rdquo; although,
as previously stated in the case of this breed, more than in any
other known to the writer, many exceptions present themselves, even
when the utmost care has been exercised, still the maxim holds good
in the main. The second law is that of Heredity, too often paid
inadequate attention to, but which demands constant and unremitting
apprehension, as it modifies the first law in many ways. It may be
briefly described as the biological law by which the general
characteristics of living creatures are repeated in their
descendants. Practically every one has noticed its workings in the
human family, how many children bear a stronger resemblance to
their grandparents, uncles, cousins, etc., than to their parents,
and in the lower order of animals, and it seems to me in the
Bostons especially, this tendency to atavism, or throwing back to
some ancestor, in many cases quite remote, is very pronounced,
hence the necessity of a good general knowledge of the pedigree and
family history of the dogs the breeder selects for his foundation
stock. A kennel cannot be built in a day; it takes time, money,
perseverance, and a strict attention to detail to insure
success.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Breed to the best,&rdquo; is a golden rule, but this
applies not only to the animals themselves, but also in a far
greater measure to the good general qualities possessed by their
ancestry. Far more pregnant with good results would be the mating
of two good all-round specimens, lacking to a considerable extent
show points, but the products of two families known for their
general excellence for several generations, than the offspring
would be of two noted prize winners of uncertain ancestry, neither
of which possessed the inherent quality of being able to reproduce
themselves. It will be noted that very few first prize winners had
prize winning sires and dams. The noted stud dogs of the past,
&ldquo;Buster,&rdquo; &ldquo;Sullivan&rsquo;s Punch,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Cracksman,&rdquo; &ldquo;Hickey&rsquo;s Teddy IV.&rdquo; and
many others were not in themselves noted winners, and the same
statement may be made of the dams of many of the prize winning
dogs, but they possessed in themselves and their ancestry that
&ldquo;hall mark&rdquo; of quality which appeared in a pronounced
form in their offspring. Experience has shown that first class
qualities must exist for several generations in order to render
their perpetuation highly probable. The converse of this is equally
true, that any bad qualities bred for the same length of time are
quite as hard to eliminate. If the dog or bitch possesses weak
points, be sure to breed to dogs coming from families that are
noted for their corresponding strong points. In this case the
principle of &ldquo;give and take&rdquo; will be adopted. It used
to be the ambition of every breeder (or, at least, most of them),
to produce a winner, rather than the production of a line of dogs
of good uniform type, of good average salable quality, but most
have lived long enough to see that this has not paid as well in
money or expected results as where similar endeavors have been
directed towards the production of good all-round dogs, always
striving to advance their dogs to a higher grade of excellence. In
this way in nearly every instance prize winning dogs have been
produced, and there is this peculiarity noticeable in this breed,
that any one, whether he be a breeder of the greatest number, or a
very poor man owning only one or two in his kitchen kennel,
possesses an equal chance of producing the winner of the blue. The
breeder of today has a far easier time than in the early days of
the dog when type was not as pronounced or fixed, and when
considerable inbreeding of necessity had to be resorted to. In
almost all parts of the country stud dogs of first class lineage
are obtainable and the general public are educated sufficiently to
understand the good points of the dog. I think the breeding of this
dog appeals to a wider class of people than any other breed, from
the man of wealth who produces the puppies to be given away as
wedding presents or Christmas gifts, down to the lone widow, or the
man incapacitated for hard work, who must do something to keep the
wolf from the door, and who finds in the raising of these charming
little pets a certain source of income and a delightful occupation
combined. I do not think that any one may apprehend that the market
will ever be overstocked, for as the dog becomes known, the desire
for possession among all classes will be correspondingly increased,
and as he is strictly an American product, no importation from
Europe can possibly supply winners, or specially good dogs, as is
the case with almost all other breeds. And the fact is demonstrated
that dogs of A 1 quality can be produced on American soil.</p>
<p>There are two or three subjects that demand the most careful
consideration at the hands of the breeder, and to which I am afraid
in many cases not particular enough attention is given. I refer in
the first place to the question of inbreeding, an admitted
necessity in the early history of the dog, but in the
writer&rsquo;s estimation very harmful and much to be discouraged
at the present time. I will yield to no man in the belief that the
fact is absolutely and scientifically true that close
consanguineous breeding is the most powerful means of determining
character and establishing type, in many instances justifiable as
the only correct way to fix desirable qualities, both physical and
mental, but extreme care must be exercised that both parties to the
union must be of good quality and not share the same defects, and
where it is evident that the extra good qualities on the one side
more than outbalance the defects of the other, and extreme
precaution must always be paid to avoid carrying this system too
far.</p>
<p>In regard to intense inbreeding, as in the case of mating dogs
from the same sire and dam, or the bitch to her sire, or dam to
son, I thing it is highly objectionable and should never under any
circumstances be resorted to; failure will ensue. Far better to let
the bitch go by unmated and lose six months than mate her in this
way because a suitable stud dog was not at the time available. I
believe that this inbreeding is productive of excessive
nervousness, weakness in physical form, the impairment of breeding
functions, and the predisposition to disease in its multiform
manifestations.</p>

<p>That eminent authority, Sir John Seabright, the originator of
the early race of bantams, known as the silver and gold spangled
Seabrights, also conducted an exhaustive series of experiments on
the inbreeding of dogs and demonstrated to an absolute certainty
that the system was productive of weakness, diminished growth, and
general weediness. His experiments had a world-wide reputation and
the writer, when he first visited his large estates near London,
little dreamed that in after years he would personally benefit by
Sir John&rsquo;s work. I believe the prevailing ideas in many
quarters a number of years ago, as to the general stupidity of the
Boston terrier (and in some isolated cases I believed well
founded), arose from the fact that it was popularly believed he was
too much inbred. I will give just one case of inbreeding in our
kennels, tried for experiment&rsquo;s sake, as a warning. I took
the most rugged bitch I possessed and mated her to her sire, a dog
of equal vigor. The result was six puppies, strong, and as handsome
as a picture. When two months old they were sold to different
parties on the Eastern seaboard, from Philadelphia up to the
Canadian line. This was before the West had &ldquo;caught on&rdquo;
to the breed. About two months later I had a letter from New York
stating that the pup was growing finely, but that he seemed to be
hard of hearing. A few days after this I received another epistle
from Salem that the puppy I had sent on was believed to be stone
deaf. It would be superfluous to add that the purchase money was
returned, and the other four customers were notified of the
condition of the others. It may seem somewhat incredible, but two
out of the four stated that they believed the pups had defective
hearing, and declined to receive their money back, and the other
two stated that before my notification they had never observed that
their dogs were deaf. Here was a case of the entire litter being
perfect practically in every other respect, and yet every one stone
deaf, and in my estimation not worth a sou. As we have never had a
case of deafness in our kennels before or since, we attribute this
solely to inbreeding.</p>
<p>Another important feature, little understood, and frequently
much dreaded, is that of Antecedent Impressions. When a bitch has
been served by a dog not of her own breed it has been proven in
extremely rare cases that the subsequent litters by dogs of her own
kind, showed traces (or, at least, one or more of the litter did)
of the dog she was first lined by. The theory by physiologists is
that the life-giving germ, implanted by the first dog, penetrates
the serous coat of the ovary, burrows into its parenchyma, and
seeks out immature ova, not to be ripened and discharged perhaps
for years, and to produce the modifying influence described. Many
breeders are unwise enough to believe that a bitch the victim of
misalliance is practically ruined for breeding purposes and discard
her. While, of course, we believe in the fact of Antecedent
Impressions, we think they are as rare as the proverbial visit of
angels. We have given this subject serious attention and have tried
numerous experiments, using various dogs to ward our bitches,
including a pug, spaniel, wire-haired fox terrier, pointer, and
perhaps one other, and we have never seen a trace of these matings
in subsequent litters. One case, for example: In another part of
this book we allude to a dog spoken of by Dr. Mott, in his
&ldquo;Treatise of the Boston Terrier,&rdquo; named &ldquo;Muggy
Dee.&rdquo; The grandmother of this charming little dog was bred in
our kennels, by name, &ldquo;St. Botolph&rsquo;s Bessie.&rdquo; We
sold her to a Boston banker, and she matured into a beautiful dog.
Upon coming in season she was unfortunately warded by a spaniel on
the estate, which so disgusted her owner that he gave her to the
coachman. She proved a perfect gold mine to him, as she raised two
litters of elegant ideal Bostons every twelve months for a great
number of years, and never at any time showed any result of the
misalliance.</p>
<p>On the subject of Mental Impressions we need say but little, as
the chances of it ever taking place are so small that we merely
give it a passing notice and say that in all our experience we have
never been troubled with a case. For the benefit of the uninitiated
will briefly state that this consists of the mental impression made
on the mind of a bitch by a dog with whom she has been denied
sexual intercourse, affecting the progeny resulting from the union
of another dog with the bitch, generally in regard to the color,
and this strange phenomena, when it does occur, is apt to mark
usually one puppy of each litter.</p>
<p>A fact not generally known by breeders is that if a bitch is
lined by a second dog at any time during heat, the chances are that
a second conception may take place, resulting in two distinct sets
of pups, half-sister or brother to each other. This fact we have
proven.</p>
<p>There is one other important feature which must be noticed
before this chapter is closed, and that is Predetermining the Sex.
Most breeders, of course, are anxious to have male pups predominate
in a litter, and it is a demonstrated fact that ordinary mating
produces from four to ten per cent more males than females. For a
number of years I had always believed it was impossible to breed so
as to attain more than the excess of males above noted, but several
years ago I accepted an invitation from Mr. Burnett, of Deerfoot
Farm, of Southboro (the owner of Kate or Gyp, the mother of the
breed), to spend the day. He was, as will be recalled, one of the
earliest and most enthusiastic breeders of the Boston, and is now a
scientific breeder of choice dairy stock. We had been discussing a
number of problems in regard to raising stock, when he exclaimed:
&ldquo;Mr. Axtell, I believe I have discovered the problem of sex
breeding. If I want heifer calves, I breed the cow as soon as she
comes in season. If a bull calf is wanted, the cow is served just
before going out of season.&rdquo; And said he, &ldquo;In nineteen
experiments I have only been unsuccessful once, and I think you
might try the same plan with your Bostons.&rdquo; I have since done
so, and although not nearly the same measure of success has
attended my experiments as his, yet by breeding bitches at the
close of the heat rather than at its commencement, the number of
males in a litter has materially increased. Again, I find if a
young, vigorous dog is bred to a similar bitch, females will
predominate in the offspring, whereas, if the same bitch is bred to
a much older dog, an excess of males will generally occur.
Occasionally some dogs will be met with that no matter what mated
with, will produce largely males, and some the opposite of this
will nearly always produce females, and some bitches, no matter how
bred, do likewise, but these are exceptions, and not the rule. A
kennel man need never worry about sex, inasmuch as good dogs of
either gender will always be in demand.</p>
<p>The law of Selection must be carefully attended to to insure the
best results. Choose your best and most typical bitches for
breeding, especially those that approximate rather to the bull type
and are rather long in body and not too narrow in their hind
quarters. I do not care if the dam has a somewhat longer tail than
the dog, my experience has been that a bitch possessing a tight
screw tail did not do quite as well in whelping as one having one a
little longer. Do not consider this as suggesting that the tail is
a matter of secondary importance, by no means, it is of primal
import, and too much attention can never be given to the production
of this distinguishing mark of the dog. A Boston without a good
tail is almost as worthless as a check without a signature.</p>
<p>Be sure at the time of breeding the bitch is free from worms. A
great many are troubled whose owners are totally ignorant of the
fact, and this frequently accounts for non-success. Always remember
that worms thrive the most when the alimentary canal is kept loaded
with indigestible or half-digested food, and that liquid foods are
favorable to these pests, while solids tend to expel them. Freshly
powdered areca nut, in teaspoonful doses, and the same quantity of
a mixture of oil of male fern and olive oil, three parts oil and
one part male fern oil, I find are both excellent vermifuges to
give to matured dogs. Give a dose and two days after repeat, and
this, I think, will be found generally effectual.</p>
<p>Do not, on any account, allow the breeding stock to become too
fat. Proper feeding and exercise, of course, will prevent this. It
will be found if this is not attended to that the organs of
generation have lost their functional activity, and if pups are
produced, are, as a rule, small and lack vigor. My experience with
Bostons is that it is very desirable to breed them as often as they
come in season; if allowed to go by it will be found increasingly
harder to get them in whelp. I think a stud dog, to last for a
reasonable number of years, should not be used more frequently than
once a week. I have found it pays best to give the bitch in whelp a
generous feed of raw meat daily. It often effectually prevents the
puppy-eating habit.</p>
<p>In closing these general hints on breeding, allow me to say
there is no reason whatever, if one has a genuine love for the dog
and is thoroughly in earnest in his attentions to it, why the
breeding problem should possess any great terrors for him. Perhaps,
before closing this chapter, it might be well to write on one or
two matters, practically of no special import, but which may at
times be instructive and illuminate some few incidents that may
puzzle the beginner.</p>
<p>I allude first to that strange phenomena known as &ldquo;false
heat,&rdquo; to which Bostons, more than any other breed with which
the writer is familiar, are liable, and which consists of the bitch
coming &ldquo;in season&rdquo; between the two periods in the year
when she legitimately should do so, and after being warded by the
dog, is, of course, not in whelp. The next is somewhat akin to
this, and consists of the fact that the bitch, after being properly
warded by a dog, notwithstanding all the external evidences of
being in whelp, even to the possession of milk in her breasts at
the expiration of the ninth week, is not so, neither has she been.
If, in addition to the above symptoms, and there has been unusual
abdominal, uterine, and breast enlargement, with a discharge of
blood for several days and no pups are in evidence, then in this
case it may safely be concluded that the offspring fell victims to
the puppy-eating habit, in which case a close watch must be kept on
the bitch at the next time of whelping, as this is a curable habit
generally. I have had two cases to my knowledge, both of which were
cured I think, largely by giving these two bitches all the raw meat
they could possibly eat while in whelp. One other fact, related
somewhat to the last two, and one that the inexperienced breeder
must give intelligent heed to, is that some bitches go through the
entire period of gestation without presenting a single sign of
pregnancy appreciable to the ordinary observer. Of course, to a dog
man the facts of the case would in all probability be known, but I
shall have to confess, after years of extended experience I myself
have been deceived two or three times. Never give up hope until the
last gun is fired.</p>
<p>I think it will generally be considered a good plan, if the
bitch is expected to whelp in the kennel she has been in the habit
of occupying, to thoroughly clean out and wash with boiling water
the box or corner she will use, to destroy all eggs and worms that
may chance to be there. I also deem it a good plan to rub gently
into her coat and over her breasts precipitated sulphur two or
three days before the expected arrival. If the bitch is suffering
from a severe case of constipation at this time, a dose of castor
oil will be of service, otherwise, let her severely alone. A bitch
that is in good health, properly fed, that has free access to good
wholesome drinking water, can safely be left without a cathartic.
Another important fact to be observed in breeding Bostons, is the
suitability of certain stud dogs for particular bitches. It used to
be my belief for a number of years, and I suppose many dog men
today entertain the same idea, that a first class dog in every
respect mated with a number of equally well bred typical bitches
would produce on an average a comparatively uniform type of pups.
Nothing could be further from actual results. The same dog bred,
say to four females practically alike in style, size, conformation,
color and markings, and from common ancestry, will give perchance
in one litter two or three crackerjacks, and the other three will
contain only medium pups. This same thing will occur every time the
dogs are bred. This is because the bitch with the choice pups and
the dog &ldquo;nick,&rdquo; a phrase signifying that some
psychological union has taken place, not understood by man, in
which the best points of both dogs are reproduced in their
offspring. Whenever one finds a dog eminently suited to his bitch,
do not make a change, always breed to the same dog. I am perfectly
cognizant of the fact that a great temptation presents itself to
want to breed to a better dog, a noted prize winner probably,
expecting, of course, that inasmuch as the dam did so well with a
somewhat inferior dog, she must of necessity do correspondingly
better with an A 1 dog. The reasoning is perfectly correct, but the
result does not correspond. Very inferior pups to her previous
litter by the inferior dog surprise and disgust the owner. In our
kennels we have had numerous examples of this. One bitch
especially, years ago, when bred to &ldquo;Buster,&rdquo; always
gave first class puppies of uniform type each litter, but the same
bitch bred to some noted prize winner always gave ordinary pups.
Another bitch that at the present time is practically retiring from
the puppy raising business from age, when bred to Hickey&rsquo;s
Teddy IV., always had in her litter four crackerjacks out of the
seven or eight she always presented us with; when bred to any other
dog (and we have tried her with several), no matter how good, never
had a first class pup in the litter. Hence I repeat, if a dog
&ldquo;nicks&rdquo; with your bitch, resulting in good pups, do not
on any account ever change. Let the marriage last for life.
Somewhat closely connected with this last fact is another equally
important, the fact of prepotency in a stud dog, consisting of the
capacity on the part of the dog to transmit his share of
characteristics to his offspring in a far larger degree than is
imparted by the average dog. Those who closely follow the breed
will discover how certain dogs do, and have done in the past, from
&ldquo;Barnard&rsquo;s Mike&rdquo; down to certain dogs of the
present time, stamp the hall-mark of excellence on all the pups
they sire, in a greater or less degree. Happy are those owners of
dams who are aware of this important fact and take pains to use in
the stud dogs of this character. I have sometimes wondered how much
Barnard&rsquo;s Mike was worth to the breed. It will be doubtless
remembered by horsemen that the great trainer, Hiram Woodruff,
speaking of the importation of the thoroughbred,
&ldquo;Messenger,&rdquo; one of the founders of the American
trotter, in 1788, said that &ldquo;when Messenger charged down the
gang-plank, in landing from the ship, the value of not less than
one hundred million dollars struck our soil.&rdquo; He would be a
very courageous man who would dare compute the worth of
&ldquo;Mike&rdquo; or &ldquo;Buster&rdquo; or
&ldquo;Sullivan&rsquo;s Punch,&rdquo; when viewed from the same
standpoint.</p>

<h2>REARING OF PUPPIES.</h2>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>Assuming that the bitch has successfully whelped and all goes
well, there is practically nothing to do beyond seeing that the
mother is well fed, in which good meat, and where there is a good
sized litter of pups, a liberal supply of milk and oatmeal gruel,
is furnished. In case the mother&rsquo;s supply of milk is
inadequate, then a foster mother must be obtained, or the pups
brought up on a bottle. If a bottle, then a small one, kept
scrupulously clean, with a rubber nipple that fits easily without
compression. The pups must be kept perfectly warm, away from
draughts, in a basket lined with flannel, and fed the first week
every hour and a half day and night, every two hours the second
week, and three hours in the third. I find that good, fresh
cow&rsquo;s milk, diluted one-quarter with warm water, is the
nearest approach to their natural food. After three weeks they can
be fed less frequently with a spoon, and can readily be taught to
lap up the milk. Where it is practical, it is always advisable to
have two or more bitches whelp together, and then the pups are
provided for if anything happens.</p>
<p>In case the bitch should lose her pups, she must be fed
sparingly and her breasts should be gently rubbed with camphorated
oil to prevent caking. It is not uncommon for Boston terrier pups
to be born with hare-lips, in which case it is far better to put
them to sleep at once, as they rarely ever live and are a deformity
if they do. Be sure that the puppies&rsquo; quarters have abundance
of sunshine and fresh air, or they will never thrive as they
should, but will be prone to disease. They are very much like
plants in this respect. When the pups are four weeks old (I used to
commence at five, but so many deaths have occurred in my kennels
that of late I have commenced a week earlier), give them a mild
vermifuge for worms. No matter if they do not show symptoms of
harboring these pests, do it just the same. You will doubtless
discover the reason very soon. Only those who have had experience
in handling and breeding puppies are aware of their danger from
worms. I know of nothing more disappointing than to go to the
kennel and find the fine litter of pups that looked so promising,
and on which such high hopes had been placed, with distended
stomachs and the flesh literally wasted away. When this is the case
do not waste a moment, administer the vermifuge. If the intestinal
walls have not yet been perforated by these pests, or too great an
inflammation of the alimentary canal produced, or convulsions
occasioned by the impression of the worms upon the head center of
the nervous system have not yet taken place, the pups, or most of
them, can be saved. Hence the need of taking time by the forelock
and getting rid of the worms before they get in their work. There
are all kinds of worm medicines on the market, and I have tried
them all. While some are all right for older pups, many of them
have proven too harsh in their effects and puppies as well as worms
have been destroyed. The following recipe I know will rid the
little tots of their trouble without injuring them:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wormseed oil, sixteen drops.</li>
<li>Oil of turpentine, two drops.</li>
<li>Oil of anise, sixteen drops.</li>
<li>Olive oil, three drachms.</li>
<li>Castor oil, four drachms.</li>
</ul>
<p>Put into a two-ounce bottle, warm slightly, shake well, and give
one-half teaspoonful, floated on the same quantity of milk. If the
worms do not pass away, repeat the dose the next day.</p>
<p>To those who would rather administer the dose in the form of a
capsule, then I strongly recommend Spratts&rsquo; Puppy Capsules,
except when the pups are unusually small. I have just written to
the Spratts people, telling them that their puppy capsules are too
large for very small pups of the Boston terrier breed, and their
manager has assured me he will have some made half the size. I
think when the pups are about seven weeks old, when they are
generally weaned, it is good, safe, precautionary measure to give
them another dose of worm medicine, when we use,</p>
<ul>
<li>Santonine, four grains.</li>
<li>Wormseed oil, twenty drops.</li>
<li>Oil of turpentine, three drops.</li>
<li>Olive of anise, sixteen drops.</li>
<li>Olive oil, two drachms.</li>
<li>Castor oil, six drachms.</li>
</ul>
<p>Warm slightly, shake thoroughly and give one teaspoonful on an
empty stomach, and I think it will be found that the worms will be
eliminated. I have found it also a good plan every little while to
give a teaspoonful of linseed oil to young dogs. For several years
I was troubled with the loss of puppies eight or nine weeks old
that had been effectually freed from worms, that seemed to
gradually fade away, as it were, but an autopsy plainly revealed
the cause. The mother, after eating a hearty meal, would return and
vomit what she had eaten on the hay which the puppies would
greedily devour. In so doing they swallowed some of the hay, which
effected a lodgment in the small intestines, not being digested,
until enough was collected to cause a stoppage, and the puppies
consequently died. The cause being removed, we lost no more pups.
As infection is always in lurk in kennels it is, I think, always
advisable to give puppies that have passed the tenth week a dose of
vermifuge occasionally until after the ninth month. When the
kennels are kept perfectly free from fleas and other noxious
insects, during the warm weather a thorough good washing once a
week is of great benefit to the growing stock, and I know of no
soap so good to use as the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 lb. of Crown Soap (English harness soap).</li>
<li>1-2 ounce of mild mercurial ointment (commonly called by the
chemists &ldquo;blue ointment&rdquo;).</li>
<li>1 ounce of powdered camphor.</li>
</ul>
<p>Mix thoroughly, and take a very small quantity and rub into the
coat, thoroughly rinsing afterwards, followed by careful drying.
Every day a good brushing will be found of great benefit, and when
an extra luster is desired in the coat, as for the show bench,
there is nothing that will do the trick as readily as to give the
coat a thorough good dressing with newly ground yellow corn meal,
carefully brushing out all the particles, which will leave the coat
immaculately clean.</p>

<p>In regard to feeding the pups after weaning, it will be found an
excellent plan to feed until ten weeks old four times a day, from
that age until six months old, three times daily, and from that age
until maturity, twice daily. I think a good drink of milk once a
day excellent, and where there are enough fresh table scraps left
to feed the pups, nothing better can be given. Where the number of
dogs kept is too numerous to be supplied in this way, then a good
meal of puppy biscuits in the morning, a good meal of meat (fresh
butcher&rsquo;s trimmings, not too fat, bought daily) with
vegetables at noon and at night well cooked oatmeal or rice with
milk makes an excellent safe diet. Good, large bones with some meat
on are always in order, as all dogs crave, and I think ought to
have, some meat raw. Be careful not to over feed, and above all do
not give the dogs sweets. When a puppy is delicate or a shy feeder,
an egg beaten up in milk forms an excellent change, and good fresh
beef or lamb minced up will tempt the most delicate appetite. Give
the puppies a chance to get out on the fresh grass and see what Dr.
Green will do for them. Above all see that they always have free
access to pure, cool water.</p>
<p>I frequently hear numerous complaints of dog&rsquo;s eyes,
especially pups that have been newly weaned, becoming inflamed, and
in many cases small ulcers form. The same thing has occasionally
happened in our kennels, and after trying practically all the eye
washes on the market, sometimes without success, I applied to a
friend of mine in the laboratory of the Massachusetts General
Hospital and was advised by him to wash the dog&rsquo;s eyes two or
three times a day with a ten per cent. solution of argyrol, which
has been eminently successful. For slight inflammations a boracic
acid wash, that any chemist will put up, will usually effect a
cure.</p>
<p>The several forms of skin disease which cause so much disquiet
to young stock, preventing rest and hindering growth, are sometimes
due to faults in feeding which upset the work of the assimilative
organs, and are to a great extent preventable. Not so those that
are due to the presence of a parasite that burrows under the skin
and produces that condition of the coat commonly known as mange. A
dog may go for some considerable time unsuspected, but the sooner
it is discovered and attended to the better, as it is highly
contagious. The first thing to do is to take an equal amount of
powdered sulphur and lard, make a paste, and rub it thoroughly into
the coat of the dog and let it stay on for two days. Of course, the
dog will lick off all he can, but the internal application will be
good for him. At the end of the second day take the dog and give
him a thorough wash with good castile soap, and after drying rub
into his coat thoroughly (care being taken that none gets into the
eyes or ears) crude petroleum. Let this stay on one day, and
without washing take this time enough benzine and powdered sulphur
to make a paste and rub in as before. It will be found that this
has penetrated deeper than the lard and sulphur did and has
doubtless reached the parasites. Repeat this twice, washing in
between, after which give the dog a good dressing of petroleum once
a day for a week, followed by a week&rsquo;s anointing with the
benzine, and dollars to doughnuts, the dog&rsquo;s coat will come
out all right. A good dressing to be applied occasionally
afterwards, well rubbed into the skin, is composed of equal parts
of castor, olive and kerosene oils, thoroughly mixed. If the hair
has long been off apply the tincture of cantharides, or the
sulphate of quinine to the bald spots, taking care the dog does not
lick it with his tongue. These two remedies are best used in the
form of an ointment, twice a day.</p>
<p>In regard to fleas or lice on the young stock, a good wash in
not too strong a solution of any of the standard tar products is
usually perfectly effectual. One other disease, and that the most
deadly of all, remains to be considered, viz., distemper. This is
largely contracted at the dog shows, or being brought into contact
with dogs suffering from the disease. I do not believe it is ever
spontaneous, and dogs kept away from infected stock will be exempt.
Well do I remember my first dose of it. I had loaned a friend of
mine a young dog raised by him to show, as he was trying for a
prize for Druid Merk as a stud dog. The dog in question, Merk Jr.,
came back from the show rather depressed, and in a few days I had
my entire kennel down with the disease. It was in the spring of the
year, cold and damp, and I succeeded in saving just one of the
young dogs and Merk Jr. After a thorough fumigation with a great
quantity of sulphur I managed to get the kennels disinfected, and
did not have an outbreak again for several years. A bitch sent to
be bred where a case of distemper existed, unknown to me, of
course, brought it to my place again, and I had the same
unfortunate experience over again; fortunately this time it was in
the early fall, and weather conditions being auspicious, we lost
only about twenty-five per cent. of young stock. By extreme
vigilance, in knowing the conditions of the kennels where bitches
were sent for service, we succeeded in escaping an attack for
several years, when an old bitch that had had distemper several
years previously, brought back the germs in her coat from a kennel
where two young dogs, just home from the Boston show, were sick
with the disease. This was in the spring, the weather was wet and
cold, and a loss of practically fifty per cent. ensued.</p>
<p>One very interesting and peculiar feature of the last attack
was, that half the dogs sick were given the best medical treatment
possible, with a loss of one-half; the other half were not given
any medicine whatever, and the same proportion died. Of course, all
had the best of care, nursing, and strict attention to diet
paid.</p>
<p>I was very much gratified to observe that in these three attacks
we have never had a dog that had a recurrence of the disease, and
what is of far greater importance, have never had any after ill
effect (with one solitary exception, when a bitch was left with a
slight twitching of one leg) in the shape of the number of ailments
that frequently follow, and in all cases after the disease had run
its course the dogs seemed in a short time as vigorous as ever.
This we attribute solely to the strong, vigorous constitutions the
dogs possessed. A breeder who raises many dogs will have a very
difficult feat to accomplish if he aspires to enter the show ring
also. In our case we were convinced at the start that these two
would not go together. When one considers that dogs returning from
shows frequently carry the germs in their coats, and even the
crates become affected, and while not suffering from the disease
themselves, will readily convey it to the occupants of the kennel
they come in contact with, also that the kennel man (unless a
separate man has charge of infected stock exclusively) can readily
carry the germs on his hands, person and clothing, it will
instantly be perceived what a risk attends the combined breeding
and showing. I think it pays best in the long run to keep these two
branches of the business separate. The temptation to exhibit will
be very strong, but before doing so, count the cost, especially if
much valuable young stock is in the kennels.</p>
<p>In regard to the treatment of this much dreaded disease, there
are a number of remedies on the market, one especially that has
lately come out, viz., &ldquo;Moore&rsquo;s Toxin,&rdquo; which
claims to effect a cure, but having never used it can not give a
personal endorsement. Whatever remedy is tried, remember that good
nursing, a suitable diet, and strict hygienic measures must be
given. Feed generously of raw eggs, beaten up in milk, in which a
few drops of good brandy are added, every few hours, and nourishing
broths and gruels may be given for a change. If the eyes are
affected then the boracic acid wash; if the nose is stopped up,
then a good steaming from the kettle. While the dog must have
plenty of fresh air, be sure to avoid draughts. When the lungs and
bronchial tubes are affected, then put flannels wrung out of hot
Arabian balsam around neck and chest, and give suitable doses of
cod liver oil. If the disease is principally seated in the
intestines, then give once a day a teaspoonful of castor oil, and
the dog should be fed with arrow root gruel, made with plenty of
good milk, and a very little lean meat (beef, mutton, or chicken),
once a day. When the dog is on the high road to recovery be very
careful he does not get cold, or pneumonia is almost certain to
ensue. Do not forget a thorough fumigation of the kennels, and all
utensils, with sulphur.</p>

<h2>BREEDING FOR SIZE.</h2>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>When I joined the Boston Terrier Club in 1895, there were two
classes for weight&mdash;the light weight, from 15 to 23 pounds,
and the heavy weight, from 23 to 30 pounds, inclusive. This, of
course, has been changed since to three classes&mdash;the light
weight, 12 and not to exceed 17 pounds; middle weight class, 17 and
not to exceed 22 pounds, and heavy weight, 22 and not to exceed 28
pounds and a class, for Toys, weighing under twelve pounds, has
been added. The Boston terrier dog was never intended, in the
writer&rsquo;s estimation, to be a dog to be carried in one&rsquo;s
pocket, but such an one as the standard calls for, and which the
oldest breeders have persistently and consistently bred. To my mind
the ideal dog is one weighing from 15 pounds for my lady&rsquo;s
parlor, to 20 or 25 pounds for the dog intended as a man&rsquo;s
companion, suitable to tackle any kind of vermin, and to be an
ideal watch dog in the house should any knights of the dark lantern
make their nocturnal calls.</p>
<p>During the past few years we have had (in common, I suppose,
with all large breeders), a great many orders for first class dogs,
typical in every respect, weighing from 30 to 40 pounds. The
constant tendency among men of wealth today is to move from the
city onto country estates, where they stay the greater part of the
year, and in many cases all the time. They are looking for first
class watch dogs that can be kept in the house or stable, that are
thoroughly reliable, that do not bring too much mud in on their
coats, that do not cover the furniture with long hairs, that are
vigorous enough to follow on a horseback ride, and which will not
wander from home. I was in the company of a party of gentlemen the
other day who had bought a number of estates in a town twenty miles
from Boston, and the subject of a suitable breed of dogs for their
residences was under discussion. All the fashionable breeds were
gone over, some were objected to because they barked too much,
others because of their propensity to rush out at teams; some that
their coats were too long and they brought a great deal of mud,
etc., in, and still others that their fighting disposition was too
pronounced, but they all agreed that a good-sized, vigorous, good
natured Boston terrier just about filled the bill. Said the nephew
of Senator Henry Cabot Lodge to me last week: &ldquo;Edward, I want
a Boston big enough to take care of himself if anything happens,
and of me also, if necessary, weighing about 35 pounds.&rdquo; A
Boston banker, who has a large place in the country, would not take
two dogs weighing under 35 pounds. Last week I received a letter
from a Mr. W. B. Bogert, of the firm of Bogert, Maltby &amp; Co.,
commission grain merchants, Chicago, ordering a &ldquo;very heavy
weight dog of kindly disposition and good blood. I can get out here
any number of light weight dogs, but I do not like them. Kindly
send me what you think will suit me.&rdquo; These are only a few
sample cases, and I can say that my orders today call for more
first class heavy weight dogs than for any other size. This is, of
course, a comparatively new feature, but all up to date breeders
will see the necessity of being able to fill this class of
orders.</p>
<p>The small sized toys will always be in demand, as they make
ideal little pets, suitable eminently for a city flat or an
apartment house, to be carried by the lady in her carriage, or to
accompany her in her walks, and they make first rate playmates for
children. This class is by far the hardest to breed. For best
results mate a bitch weighing about fifteen pounds, that comes from
a numerous litter, to a twelve-pound dog that comes from small
ancestry. Some of the pups are bound to be small. One important
feature in the production of small pups is this: Bitches that whelp
in the fall, the smallest pups are raised from, especially if the
pups are fed a somewhat restricted diet, whereas puppies that are
raised in the spring, that are generously fed, and have vigorous
exercise in the sunshine, attain a far greater size. A great many
breeders underfeed their young stock to stop growth, which I
believe to be a very grave mistake. There is no question whatever
it accomplishes the result wished, but at the expense of stamina
and a fine, generous disposition. The pups from stock advanced in
years, or from bitches excessively fat are very apt to run small,
as are also the offspring of inbred parents. One very important
fact in regard to breeding for large sized dogs to be considered is
this: While a great many breeders always select for the production
of large pups large bitches and dogs, yet experience has proven
that the majority of big ones have been the offspring of medium
sized dams that were bred to strong, heavy-boned dogs of substance.
I bred a bitch weighing twenty pounds to a large bull terrier that
weighed forty-five pounds for an experiment, and the pups, five in
number, weighed at maturity from thirty-five to forty pounds, with
noses and tails nearly as long as their sire&rsquo;s, and his
color, but were very nice in their disposition, and were given away
for stable dogs. Progressive up-to-date kennel men will see that
they have on hand not only the three classes called for by the
standard, but the fourth class, so to speak, that I have mentioned
above, those weighing anywhere from thirty to forty pounds. Quite a
number of breeders in the past have put in the kennel pail at birth
extra large pups that they thought would mature too large to sell,
but they need do so no longer. This precaution must always be taken
where there are one or more of these large size puppies, viz., to
look out that they do not get more than their proportionate share
of the milk, or later the food, as they are very apt to crowd out
the others.</p>
<p>Remember that the Boston terrier of whatever size will always
hold his own as a companion, a dog that can be talked to and
caressed, for between the dog and his owner will always be found a
bond of affection and sympathetic understanding.</p>

<h2>BREEDING FOR GOOD DISPOSITION.</h2>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>This, to my mind, is the most important feature in the breeding
of the dog that demands the most careful attention. If the
disposition of the dog is not all that can be desired, of what
avail is superb constitution, an ideal conformation and beautiful
color and markings? Better by far obtain the most pronounced
mongrel that roams the street that shows a loving, generous nature
if he cost his weight in gold, than take as a gift the most royally
bred Boston that could not be depended upon at all times and under
all circumstances to manifest a perfect disposition.</p>
<p>A short time ago I went to visit a noted pack of English fox
hounds. One beautiful dog especially, took my eye, a strong,
vigorous, noble-looking fellow, and on my asking the kennel man, a
quaint old Scotchman, if he would let the dog out for me to see, he
replied: &ldquo;Why, certainly, Mr. Axtell, that dog is Dashwood,
he is a perfect gentleman,&rdquo; and this is what all Boston
terriers should be. Of course, I am speaking of the well bred,
properly trained, blue blooded dog, not the mongrel that so often
masquerades under his name. Still, as there are black sheep in
every family, a dog showing an ugly, snapping, quarrelsome
disposition will occasionally be met with which, to the shame of
the owner, is not mercifully put out of the way and buried so deep
that he can not be scratched up, but is allowed to perpetuate his
or her own kind to the everlasting detriment of the breed.</p>
<p>How many a one has come away from a dog show utterly disgusted
with perhaps one of the best looking dogs on the bench, who, after
admiring its attractiveness in every detail, discovers on too near
an approach to him that he possesses a snappy, vicious
disposition?</p>
<p>I am perfectly well aware that due allowance must be made for
the unnatural excitement that surrounds a dog, perhaps for the
first time shown, away from all he knows, and surrounded by strange
noises and faces. Yet I consider it an outrage on the public who
give their time and pay their money, to subject them to any risk of
being bitten by any dog, I care not of what breed it may be. At a
recent show in Boston, in company with three or four gentlemen, I
was admiring a very handsome looking Boston, a candidate for high
honors, when his owner called out to me: &ldquo;Mr. Axtell, do not
go too near him or he will bite your fingers off.&rdquo; I replied:
&ldquo;You need not advise an old dog man like me; I can tell by
the look of his eye what he would do if given a chance. You have no
right whatever to show such a dog.&rdquo; Since then I went to the
kennels where a noted prize winner is placed at public stud, and he
showed such a vicious disposition and attempt to bite through the
bars of his pen that the attendant had to cover the bars over with
a blanket. Such dogs as these should be given at once a sufficient
amount of chloroform and a suitable burial without mourners. If a
man must keep such a brute, then a strong chain and a secure place
where his owner alone can visit him is absolutely imperative.</p>
<p>Boston terriers, of all breeds, must possess perfect
dispositions if they are to maintain their present popularity; and
yet, how many unscrupulous breeders and dealers are palming off
upon a confiding public dogs which, instead of being &ldquo;put
away&rdquo; (I think that is the general term they use) should be
put under so much solid mother earth that no one would suspect
their interment. I know it takes considerable grit and force of
character to cheerfully put to sleep a dog for which perhaps a
large sum of money has been paid, that has developed an uncertain,
snappy disposition, yet it pays so to do; honesty is not alone the
best policy, but the only one. In my experience as a dog man I
could give many personal incidents concerning the sale of vicious
dogs, but for space sake one must suffice.</p>
<p>Last year a Chicago banker sent me an order for a dog similar in
style and disposition to the one I had sold him a few years
previously, to go to his niece, a young lady staying for treatment
at a large sanatorium in southern Massachusetts. I replied that I
had not in my kennels a large enough dog to suit, but that I knew a
dealer who possessed a fairly good reputation who had, and would
get him for him if he would run the chances. This was satisfactory,
and I bought the dog. He was guaranteed to me as all right in every
way, but I felt somewhat suspicious, as the price was very low for
a dog of his style. I kept him with me for a week and saw no outs
whatever about him, and practically concluded my suspicions were
unfounded.</p>
<p>Upon taking the dog personally to the young lady in question, I
told her his history as far as I knew it, and also that while I
could give her the dealer&rsquo;s guarantee of the dog I could not
of course, endorse it, but that if she cared to run the risk she
could have the dog on approval as long as she wished. I said in
warning that there was something about his eye that did not
altogether strike my fancy, and that if he showed the least symptom
of being anything but affectionate, to ship him to my kennels in
Cliftondale immediately. As he was a handsome dog, with beautiful
color, I could see she wanted him at once, and the dog seemed to
take to her in an even greater degree. I received a letter from her
in a week&rsquo;s time, saying how perfectly satisfactory the dog
was in every way, and what a general favorite he had become with
the lady patients there, several of whom would like me to get one
like him for them. I need not say how pleased I was to hear this,
but what was my surprise to receive a letter the next day asking me
to send at once for the dog, as he had bitten the matron. You may
depend that neither she nor any other of the inmates there would
ever want to see a Boston again, and who would want them to? Of
course I lost my money, but that is not worth mentioning. The
sorrow I felt stays by me today. I sent for the dog and kept him at
my kennels for five months, taking care of him myself and never
letting him out of my sight, during which time he was as gentle as
a kitten, until one day a young dog man came down into the yard,
and the dog, for some unaccountable reason, as in the case of the
matron, jumped on him and took hold of his sleeve. The man, being
accustomed to dogs, was fortunately not scared. This explained the
low price of the dog, and it is needless to add, he ornamented my
kennels no longer. I can only state in connection with this that
that dealer has sold very few dogs since. I never purchase a dog
now, unless I know the man from whom I buy.</p>
<p>How to breed dogs possessing an ideal disposition is the
all-important question, and I give the rules as followed in our
kennels with complete success. Breed only from stock that you know
comes from an ancestry noted for this particular feature. Many dogs
are naturally of an affectionate nature, but have been made
snappish by ill treatment, or teasing. This can be bred out by
judicious care, but where a vicious tendency is hereditary, look
out for trouble ahead. Damages for dog bites come high, and he must
be either a very rich man, or a very poor one, that can afford to
keep this kind of stock.</p>
<p>Use only thoroughly healthy stock; disease is often productive
of an uneven, sullen disposition. See that the bitch especially
never shows a tendency to be cross or snappy. The male dog usually
controls the shape, color and markings, and the dam the
constitution and disposition. Hence it is, if anything, of more
importance that the female should be strong in this feature than
the male, although the male, of course, should be first class also.
So well known is this physiological fact that breeders of standard
bred horses, particularly hunters and carriage horses, will never
breed a vicious mare to a quiet stallion, and yet they are
generally willing to risk breeding a quiet mare to a stallion not
as good in this respect.</p>
<p>The education of the puppies should begin as soon as they can
run around. Very much depends upon a right start. We are admonished
to &ldquo;train up a child in the way he should go,&rdquo; and this
applies with equal force to the dog. Treat them with the utmost
kindness, but with a firm hand. Be sure they are taught to mind
when spoken to, and never fail to correct at once when necessary. A
stitch in time saves many times nine. A habit once formed is hard
to break. Never be harsh with them; never whip; remember that
judicious kindness with firmness is far more effective with dogs,
as with children. Be sure to accustom them to mingle with people
and children, and introduce them as early as possible to the sights
of the street, to go on ahead, and to come at your call. Prevent
the pernicious habit of running and barking at teams, etc., and
other dogs. The time to check these habits as aforesaid is before
they become fixed. If, after all these pains, you see a dog show
the slightest disposition to be vicious, then do not hesitate to
send him at once by a humane transit to dog heaven. By thus
continuously breeding a strain of dogs with an affectionate nature
and the elimination of any that show the least deviation from the
same, in a short time kennels can be established whose dogs will
not only be a source of supreme satisfaction to the owner, but will
be the best advertisers of said kennels wherever they go.</p>
<p>It will readily be admitted by all who have given the matter any
consideration that a dog of an affectionate nature, whose fidelity
has always been constant, and whose devotion to its owner has
always under all circumstances been perfectly sincere and lasting,
makes an appeal to something that is inherent in human nature. The
fact of the case is that the love of such a dog is imbedded in the
soul of every normal man and woman who have red blood in their
veins. I think it is instinctive, and has its foundation in the
fact that from the beginning of time he has ministered to
man&rsquo;s necessities, and has accompanied him as his best friend
on man&rsquo;s upward march to civilization and enlightenment.
&ldquo;There may be races of people who have never known the dog,
but I very much question if, after they have made his acquaintance,
they fail to appreciate his desirable qualities, and to conceive
for him both esteem and affection.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>BREEDING FOR A VIGOROUS CONSTITUTION.</h2>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>I think there never was a time in the history of the breed when
this particular feature needed more thoughtful, systematic and
scientific attention devoted to it than now. For the past few years
breeders have been straining every nerve, and leaving no stone
unturned, to produce small stock, toys, in fact, and everyone
realizes, who has given the question thoughtful consideration, that
this line of breeding has been at the expense of the vigor, and
indirectly largely of a beautiful disposition, of the dog, to say
nothing of the financial loss that must inevitably ensue.</p>
<p>Said an old Boston terrier man (Mr. Barnard) at a recent show:
&ldquo;Mr. Axtell, if they keep on breeding at this rate, it
won&rsquo;t be long before they produce a race of black and
tans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In my estimation it will not be black and tan terriers, but
nothing. It will be productive of a line of bitches that are either
barren, or so small that they can not possibly whelp without the
aid of a &ldquo;Vet.&rdquo; One does not have to look very far to
discover numbers of men who started in the breeding of the American
dog with high hopes and enthusiastic endeavors to success, who have
fallen by the wayside, owing largely to the fact that proper
attention was not paid to the selection of suitable breeding stock,
especially the matrons. Said a man to me last year: &ldquo;Much as
I love the dog, and crazy as I am to raise some good pups, I have
given up for all time trying to breed Boston terriers. I have lost
eight bitches in succession whelping.&rdquo; We have all of us
&ldquo;been there&rdquo; and quite a number of us &ldquo;many a
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In order to obtain strong, vigorous puppies that will live and
develop into dogs that will be noted for vigorous constitutions, we
shall simply, and in language that can be readily understood by the
novice as well as the established breeder, lay down the rules that
a quarter of a century has demonstrated to be the correct ones for
the attainment of the same as used in our kennels. As all puppies
that leave our place are sold with the guarantee of reaching
maturity (unless shown, when we take no risks whatever in regard to
distemper, mange, etc.), it will readily be seen that they must
have a first class start, and must of necessity be the progeny of
stock possessing first class vigor and the quality of being able to
transmit the same to their offspring. An ounce of experience is
worth many tons of theory, and it is, then, with pleasure we give
the system pursued by us, feeling certain that the same measure of
success will attend others that will take the necessary pains to
attain the same, and they will be spared the many pitfalls and
mistakes that have necessarily been ours before we acquired our
present knowledge. It has been for a number of years (starting as
we did when the breed was in its infancy, and only the intense love
of the dog, coupled with an extensive leisure, which enabled us to
devote a great deal of attention to important and scientific
experiments, have enabled us to arrive where we are), an uphill
road, the breeding problems have had to be solved at the outlay of
brains, patience and considerable money. Unlike any established
breed, there was practically no data to fall back on, no books of
instruction to follow, but if the pioneer work has been arduous the
results obtained have far outbalanced it, and the dog today stands
as a monument to all the faithful, conscientious and determined
body of men who would never acknowledge defeat, but who, in spite
of all discouragements from all quarters, and from many where it
should have been least expected, have pressed forward until they
find the object of their unfailing endeavors the supreme favorite
in dogdom the continent over.</p>
<p>In the first place, in the attainment of vigorous puppies, we
state the bitches selected are of primary importance, in our view,
as already stated, far more so than the sire. For best results we
choose a bitch weighing from fifteen to twenty-five pounds. If they
happen to weigh over this we do not consider it any detriment
whatever, rather otherwise. Always select said matrons from litters
that have been large, bred from strong, vigorous stock, thoroughly
matured, and that have been bred by reliable (we speak advisedly)
men for several generations if possible. If one can, obtain from
kennels that while perfectly comfortable, have not been supplied
with artificial heat. There is more in this than appears on the
surface. Dogs that have been coddled and brought up around a stove
rarely have stamina and vitality enough to enable them to live the
number of years they are entitled to, and fall a ready victim to
the first serious trouble, whether distemper, or the many and one
ills that beset their path. Intelligent breeders of all kinds of
stock today recognize the value of fresh air and unlimited
sunshine, and if best results are to be obtained these two things
are imperative.</p>
<p>I was very much interested in the prize herd of Hereford cattle
owned by Mr. Joseph Rowlands, near Worcester, England, and conceded
by experts to be the best in that country, and to learn that for a
number of years the herd (over one hundred in number) have been
kept in the open, the cows being placed in the barn for a few days
at calving, and that the prize winning bull that heads the herd,
&ldquo;Tumbler,&rdquo; is sixteen years old, and still used, and it
is stated by Mr. Rowlands is producing as good stock today as ever.
The significant fact about this herd is, they are and have been
perfectly free from tuberculosis. Another herd of Jerseys (although
not prize winners) are kept near there, under precisely the same
conditions with similar results. A breeder of prize winning Belgian
hares has kept these for a number of years without artificial heat,
with the best of results with freedom from disease, and the
attainment of strong, robust constitutions. When puppies are four
months old (in the winter time) they should be placed in well built
kennels, without artificial heat. (Of course, this does not apply
to a colder latitude than Massachusetts.)</p>
<p>The reason for choosing bitches that come from dams noted for
their large litters is this: the chances are (if the dog bred to
comes from a similar litter) that they will inherit the propensity
to give birth to large litters themselves, and the pups will
necessarily be smaller than when only one or two pups are born. The
bitch that has but that number runs an awful risk, especially if
she has been well fed. The pups will be large and the dam has great
difficulty in whelping.</p>
<p>If toy bitches are bred, look out for breakers ahead; only a
very small per cent. live to play with their little ones. A toy
bitch, bred to a toy dog, will frequently have but one pup, and
that quite a large one in proportion to the size of parents. When a
toy bitch is bred, attend carefully to these three things. See that
the dog used is small in himself, comes from small stock, and does
not possess too large a head. Secondly, be sure the bitch is kept
in rather poor condition, in other words, not too fat; and thirdly,
and this is the most important of all, see that she has all the
natural exercise she can be induced to take. These conditions
strictly and faithfully adhered to may result in success.</p>
<p>In the next place, the consideration of the dog to be used is in
order. Whether he be a first prize winner or an equally good dog
that has never been shown (and the proportion of the best raised
dogs that appear on the bench is very small) insist on the
following rules:</p>
<p>Be sure that the dog is typical with first class constitution,
vigorous, and possessing an ideal disposition, and what is of the
utmost importance, that he comes from a line of ancestry eminently
noted for these characteristics. Breed to no other, though he were
a winner of a thousand first prizes. I prefer a symmetrical dog
weighing from sixteen to twenty pounds, rather finer in his make-up
than the bitch, and possessing the indefinable quality of style,
and evidences in his make-up courage and a fine, open, generous
temperament. Do not breed to a dog that is overworked in the stud,
kept on a board floor chained up in a kennel or barn, and never
given a chance to properly exercise. If you do the chances are that
one of three things will happen: the bitch will not be in whelp
(the most likely result) the pups, or some of them will be born
dead, and one runs an awful risk of the bitch dying, or, if alive
at birth, a very small per cent. only of the pups will live to
reach maturity. I think Boston terriers are particularly
susceptible to worms or distemper, and it is absolutely imperative
that they should not be handicapped at the onset.</p>
<p>One other very important factor is natural exercise for the
bitch. Unless one is willing to take the necessary pains to give
her this, give up all expectation of ever succeeding in raising
puppies.</p>

<p>Someone asked a noted critic whom he considered the best singer
he had ever heard, and he answered, &ldquo;Patti.&rdquo; In being
asked who came next, he replied, &ldquo;Patti;&rdquo; and on being
questioned who was his third choice, gave the same answer. Were I
asked the three most important essentials for the success of the
brood bitch, I should say, &ldquo;Exercise, exercise,
exercise.&rdquo; By this I do not mean leading with a chain,
running behind a horse or team, but the natural exercise a bitch
will take if left to her own devices. Nature has provided an
infallible monitor to direct the dog the best amount to take, and
when to take it. One of the best bitches I ever possessed was one
weighing fourteen pounds by the original Tony Boy (one of the best
little dogs that ever lived) out of a bitch by Torrey&rsquo;s Ned,
by A. Goode&rsquo;s Ned. Her name was Lottie, and she had thirteen
litters and raised over ninety per cent. Those who have read that
interesting little book on the &ldquo;Boston Terrier,&rdquo; by the
late Dr. Mott, will readily recall the genial Doctor speaking of
the first Boston he ever owned, named &ldquo;Muggy Dee,&rdquo; and
how intelligent he was, and what a number of tricks the Doctor
taught him, will be interested to know that Lottie was his
great-grandmother, and she was equally intelligent. We had several
bitches by the celebrated Mr. Mullen&rsquo;s &ldquo;Boxer&rdquo;
out of her, (this is going back to ancient history), one of which,
&ldquo;Brownie,&rdquo; was, to my fancy, the nicest dog we ever
had. She, with the rest of the litter, had the run of several
hundred acres, and many times I did not see them for days together.
They went in and out of the hayloft at pleasure, and spent the
greater part of their time hunting and digging out skunks and
woodchucks which were quite thick in the woods back of us at that
time. I remember the first time Brownie was bred to that king of
sires, &ldquo;Buster,&rdquo; owned by Alex. Goode (than whom a more
loyal Boston terrier man never lived), and I was rather anxious to
see the litter when it arrived, as from the mating I expected
crackerjacks. I had not seen her or her mother for two or three
days, but the time for whelping having arrived, was keeping a close
watch on the stable. About dusk she came in with Lottie, and in a
short time gave birth to four of the most vigorous, perfectly
formed little tots I had ever seen. Each one proved to be good
enough to show, although only one was sold to an exhibitor, Mr. G.
Rawson, the rest going into private hands. &ldquo;Druid Pero&rdquo;
was shown in New York in 1898, taking first prize and silver cup
for best in his class, but I think his brother,
&ldquo;Caddie,&rdquo; beat him, his owner, a Boston banker, being
offered a number of times ten times the sum he paid for him.</p>
<p class="spaced_break">The day after Brownie whelped she and her
mother went off for an hour or so, and they finished digging out
Mr. Skunk (which the attention to her maternal duties necessitated
a postponement of), the old dog dragging him home in triumph. I
attribute the success these dogs, in common with the rest of the
bitches in the kennels who had similar advantages, had in whelping
and the rearing of their young to the fact that they always had
unlimited natural exercise. I can enumerate scores of cases similar
to these attended with equally good results, if space
permitted.</p>
<p class="spaced_break">In regard to mating, one service, if
properly performed, is usually enough, if the bitch is ready to
take the dog. If a bitch should fail to be in whelp I should advise
the next time she comes in season two or even three visits to the
dog, and where convenient I should suggest a different dog this
time. In case this time these services were unsuccessful, then I
should suggest the course that breeders of thoroughbred horses
pursue, viz., to let the female run with the male for three or four
days together. There are many things connected with breeding that
we do not understand, and frequently going back to nature, as in
this case, is productive of results when all else fails.</p>
<p>One very important factor in the production of strong, rugged
pups that live, is good feeding. Do not imagine that feeding dog
biscuits to the bitch in whelp will give good results, it will not;
she needs meat and vegetables once a day. Biscuits are all right as
a supplementary food, but that is all. Meat is the natural food for
a dog, and it is a wise kennel man that can improve on nature. Be
sure the meat is free from taint, especially at this time and when
the bitch is nursing pups. The gastric juice of a dog&rsquo;s
stomach is a great germicide, but there is a limit.</p>
<p>Be certain the dogs have a plentiful supply of good, pure water.
This is of far more importance than many people imagine.</p>
<p>Do not administer drugs of any description to your dogs, except
in the case of a good vermifuge, if they are harboring worms, and a
proper dose of castor oil if constipated. If the dog at any time is
sick, consult a good veterinary accustomed to dogs, not one who has
practiced entirely on horses or cows. If a bitch, at the time of
whelping, is much distressed and can not proceed, get a veterinary
and get him quick. When the pups arrive, if all is well and they
are able to nurse, let them severely alone. If they are very weak
they will have to be assisted to suckle&mdash;do not delay
attention in this case. Be sure the box the bitch whelped in is
large enough for her to turn around in, and do not use any material
in the nest that the pups can get entangled with. My advice to
breeders is, if the bitch is fully formed and grown to her full
proportions, to breed the first time she comes in season. She will
have an easier time whelping than when she is older. If delicate or
immature, delay breeding till the next time. Do not use a dog in
the stud until he is a year and a half old for best results; they
will, of course, sire pups at a year or younger, but better wait.
To those people who live in the city, or where a kennel can not be
established for want of adequate room to give the dogs the
necessary exercise, an excellent plan to follow is one adopted by
an acquaintance of mine, and followed by him for a number of years
with a good measure of success. He owns one or two good stud dogs
that he keeps at his home, and he has put out on different farms,
within a radius of ten miles of Boston, one bitch at each place,
and pays the farmer (who is only too glad to have this source of
income at the outlay of so little trouble and expense) one hundred
dollars for each litter of pups the bitch has, the farmer to
deliver the pups when required, usually when three months old. The
farmer brings in the bitch to be bred, and the owner has no further
trouble. The pups, when delivered, are usually in the pink of
condition and are, in a great measure, house broken, and their
manners to a certain extent cultivated. He has no trouble whatever
with pups when ordered, as he simply sends the address of customers
and the farmer ships them. This, to me, is a very uninteresting and
somewhat mercenary way of doing business, as one misses all the
charm of breeding and the bringing up of the little tots, to many
of us the most delightful part of the business. To those breeders
who have newly started in, do not get discouraged if success does
not immediately crown your efforts; remember, if Boston terriers
could be raised as easily as other dogs, the prices would
immediately drop to the others&rsquo; level.</p>

<h2>BREEDING FOR COLOR AND MARKINGS.</h2>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>Every one who has a Boston terrier for sale knows that a
handsome seal or mahogany brindle with correct markings, with
plenty of luster in the coat, provided all other things are equal,
sells more readily at a far higher price than any other. When one
considers the number of points given in the standard for this
particular feature, and the very important factor it occupies in
the sale of the dog, too much attention cannot be given by breeders
for the attainment of this desideratum. I am, of course, thoroughly
in sympathy with the absolute justice that should always prevail in
the show ring in the consideration of the place color and markings
occupy in scoring a candidate for awards. Twelve points are allowed
in the standard for these, and any dog, I care not whether it be
&ldquo;black, white, gray, or grizzled,&rdquo; that scored thirteen
points over the most perfectly marked dog, should be awarded the
prize. But be it ever remembered that the show ring and the selling
of a dog are two separate and distinct propositions. In the
writer&rsquo;s opinion and experience a wide gulf opens up between
a perfect white or black dog comporting absolutely to the standard,
and one of desirable color and markings that is off a number of
points. I have always found a white, black, mouse, or liver colored
dog, I care not how good in every other respect, almost impossible
to get rid of at any decent price. People simply would not take
them. Perhaps my experience has run counter to others. I trust it
may have done so, but candor compels me to make this statement.</p>
<p>I find that this condition of things is somewhat misleading,
especially to beginners in the breed. They have seen the awards
made in the shows (with absolute justice, as already stated), and
have naturally inferred that in consequence of this, breeding for
desirable colors was not of paramount importance after all. Only a
month or two ago an article appeared in a charming little dog
magazine, written evidently by an amateur, on this question of
color and markings. He had visited the Boston Terrier Club show
last November, and speaking of seal brindles, said: &ldquo;If this
color is so very desirable it seems strange that so few were seen,
and that so many of the leading terriers were black and white, and
some white entirely,&rdquo; then follows his deduction, viz.,
&ldquo;the tendency evidently is that color is immaterial with the
best judges, so that a breeder is foolish to waste his time on side
issues which are not material.&rdquo; I can only state in passing
that if he had a number of dogs on hand that were of the colors he
specifies, &ldquo;black and white, and some white entirely,&rdquo;
it would doubtless &ldquo;seem strange&rdquo; to him why they
persisted in remaining on his hands as if he had given each one an
extra bath in Le Page&rsquo;s liquid glue. Pitfalls beset the path
of the beginner and this book is written largely to avoid them.
When one reads or hears the statement made that color and markings
are of secondary consideration or even less, take warning. The
reader&rsquo;s pardon will now have to be craved for the apparent
egotism evidenced by the writer in speaking of himself in a way
that only indirectly concerns canine matters, but which has a
bearing on this very important question of color, and partially, at
least, explains why this particular feature of the breeding of the
Boston terrier has appealed to him so prominently. My father was a
wholesale merchant in straw goods, and had extensive dye works and
bleacheries where the straw, silk and cotton braids were colored.
As a youngster I used to take great delight in watching the dyers
and bleachers preparing their different colors and shades, etc.,
and was anxious to see the results obtained by the different
chemical combinations. When a young man, while studying animal
physiology under the direction of the eminent scientist, Professor
Huxley, whose diploma I value most highly, I made a number of
extended scientific experiments in color breeding in poultry and
rabbits, so that when I took up breeding Boston terriers later in
life this feature particularly attracted me. I was
&ldquo;predisposed,&rdquo; as a physician says of a case where the
infection is certain, hence I offer no apology whatever for the
assertion that this chapter is scientifically correct in the rules
laid down for the breeding to attain desirable shades and
markings.</p>
<p>When we first commenced breeding Bostons in 1885, the prevailing
shades were a rather light golden brindle (often a yellow), and
mahogany brindles, and quite a considerable number had a great deal
of white. Then three shades were debarred, viz., black, mouse and
liver, and although years after the Boston Terrier Club removed
this embargo, they still remain very undesirable colors.</p>
<p>The rich mahogany brindle next became the fashionable color (and
personally I consider it the most beautiful shade), and Mr. A.
Goode with Champion &ldquo;Monte&rdquo; and Mr. Rawson with the
beautiful pair, &ldquo;Druid Merke&rdquo; and &ldquo;Vixen,&rdquo;
set the pace and every one followed. A few years later Messrs.
Phelps and Davis (who, with the above mentioned gentlemen, were
true friends of the breed), sold a handsome pair of seal brindles,
Chs. &ldquo;Commissioner II.&rdquo; and &ldquo;Topsy,&rdquo; to Mr.
Borden of New York, and confirmed, if not established, the fashion
for that color in that city. I think that all people will agree,
from all parts of the country, that New York sets the style for
practically everything, from my lady&rsquo;s headgear to the
pattern of her equipages, and the edict from that city has decreed
that the correct color in Boston terriers is a rich seal brindle,
with white markings, with plenty of luster to it, and all sections
of the continent promptly say amen!</p>
<p>I have taken the pains to look up a number of orders that we
have recently received, which include (not enumerating those
received from the New England States, or New York), three from
Portland, Oregon, one from California, one from St. Louis, one from
Mexico, four from Canada, two from Chicago, and one from Texas, and
with the exception of two who wished to replace dogs bought of us
ten or twelve years previously, they practically all wanted seal
brindles.</p>
<p>These orders were nearly all from bankers and brokers, men who
are supposed to be en rapport with the dictates of fashion. It goes
without saying that what a public taste demands, every effort will
be made to attain the same, and breeders will strive their utmost
to produce this shade. Many who do not understand scientific
matings to obtain these desirable colors have fallen into a very
natural mistake in so doing. In regard to the mahogany brindles
they say, why not breed continuously together rich mahogany sires
and dams, and then we shall always have the brindles we desire.
&ldquo;Like produces like&rdquo; is a truism often quoted, but
there are exceptions, and Boston terrier breeding furnishes an
important one. A very few years of breeding this way will give a
brown, solid color, without a particle of brindle, or even worse, a
buckskin. If the foundation stock is a lighter brindle to start,
the result will be a mouse color. The proper course to pursue is to
take a golden brindle bitch that comes from a family noted for that
shade, and mate her with a dark mahogany brindle dog that comes
from an ancestry possessed of that color. The bitch from this
mating can be bred to dark mahogany brindles, and the females from
this last mating bred again to dark mahogany males, but now a
change is necessary. The maxim, &ldquo;twice in and once
out,&rdquo; applies here. The last bred bitches should be bred this
time to a golden brindle dog, and same process repeated, that is,
the bitches from this last union and their daughters can be bred to
dark mahogany brindle dogs, when the golden brindle sire comes in
play again. This can be repeated indefinitely. A rule in color
breeding to be observed is this: that the male largely influences
the color of the pups. If darker colors are desired, use a darker
male than the female. If lighter shades are desired, use a lighter
colored male.</p>
<p>If a tiger brindle is wanted, take a gray brindle bitch and mate
to a dark mahogany dog. Steel and gray brindles are in so little
demand and are so easy to produce that we shall not notice
them.</p>
<p>In regard to seal brindles. A great many breeders who do not
understand proper breeding to obtain them have fallen into the same
pit as the others. In their desire to obtain the dark seal brindles
they have mated very dark dogs to equally dark bitches, which has
resulted in a few generations in producing dogs absolutely black in
color, with coats that look as if they had been steeped in a pail
of ink. A visit to any of the leading shows of late will reveal the
fact that quite a number of candidates for bench honors are not
real brindle, except possibly on the under side of the body, or
perchance a slight shading on the legs. A considerable number are
perfectly black, and are called by courtesy black brindles. As well
call the ace of spades by the same name. A serious feature in
connection with this is, that the longer this line of breeding is
persisted in, the harder will be the task to breed away. In fact,
in my estimation it will be as difficult as the elimination of
white. One important fact in connection here is that black color is
more pronounced from white stock than from brindle. I recently went
into the kennels of a man who has started a comparatively short
time ago, and who has been most energetic in his endeavors to
produce a line of dark seal brindles, and who is much perplexed
because he has a lot of stock on hand, while first rate in every
other respect, are with coats as black as crows and not worth ten
dollars apiece. He seemed very much surprised when I told him his
mistake, but grateful to be shown a way out of his difficulty. A
visit to another kennel not far from the last revealed the fact
that the owner was advertising and sending largely to the West what
he called black brindles, but as devoid of brindle as a frog is of
feathers. His case was rather amusing, as he honestly believed that
because the dog was a Boston terrier its color of necessity must be
a brindle. He reminded me a good deal of a man who started a dog
store in Boston a number of years ago who advertised in his windows
a Boston terrier for sale cheap. Upon stepping in to see the dog
all that presented itself to view was a dog, a cross between a fox
and bull terrier. When the man was told of this, he made this
amusing reply: &ldquo;The dog was born in Boston, and he is a
terrier. Why is he not a Boston terrier?&rdquo; Upon telling him
that according to his reasoning if the dog had been born in New
York city he would be a New York terrier he smiled. Fortunately I
had &ldquo;Druid Pero&rdquo; with me and said: &ldquo;Here is a dog
bred in my kennels at Cliftondale, Mass., that was a first prize
winner at the last New York show, and yet he is a Boston
terrier.&rdquo; After looking Pero carefully over he exclaimed:
&ldquo;Well, by gosh, they don&rsquo;t look much like brothers, but
I guess some greenhorn will come along who will give me twenty-five
dollars for him,&rdquo; and on inquiring a little later was told
the green gentleman had called and bought the dog.</p>
<p>How to breed the dogs so that the brindle will not become too
dark, with the bright reddish sheen that sparkles in the sun, is
the important question, and I am surprised at the ignorance
displayed by kennel men that one would naturally suppose would have
made the necessary scientific experiments to obtain this desirable
shading. Only a short time ago a doctor, a friend of mine, told me
he had just started a kennel of Bostons, buying several bitches at
a bargain on account of their being black in color, and that he
proposed breeding them to a white dog to get puppies of a desirable
brindle. He seemed quite surprised when told the only shades he
could reasonably expect would be black, white and splashed, all
equally undesirable.</p>
<p>The system adopted in our kennels some years ago to obtain seal
brindles with correct markings and the desirable luster and reddish
sheen to the coat is as follows:</p>
<p>We take a rich red, or light mahogany bitch, with perfect
markings, that comes from a family noted for the brilliancy of
their color, and without white in the pedigrees for a number of
generations, and mate her always to a dark seal brindle dog with an
ancestry back of him noted for the same color. The pups from these
matings will come practically seventy-five per cent. medium seal
brindles. We now take the females that approximate the nearest in
shade to their mother, and mate them to a dark seal brindle dog
always. The bitches that are the result of this union are always
bred to a dark seal brindle dog. The females that come from the
last union are bred to a medium seal brindle dog, but now comes the
time to introduce a mahogany brindle dog as a sire next time, for
if these last bitches were mated to a seal brindle dog a large per
cent. of the pups would come too dark or even black. This system is
used indefinitely and desirable seal brindles with white markings
can thus be always obtained. To the best of my recollection we have
had but one black dog in twenty years. We have demonstrated, we
trust, so that all may understand how golden, mahogany, and seal
brindles are obtained, and how they may be bred for all time
without losing the brindle so essential, and we now pass on to the
consideration of a far harder problem, the obtaining of the rich
seal brindles from all undesirable colors, and we present to all
interested in this important, and practically unknown and
misunderstood, problem the result of a number of years extended and
scientific experiments which, we confess, were disheartening and
unproductive for a long time, but which ultimately resulted in
success, the following rules to be observed, known as &ldquo;The
St. Botolph Color Chart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In presenting this we are fully aware that as far as we know
this is the only scientific system evolved up to date, also that
there are a number of breeders of the American dog who maintain
that this is an absolute impossibility, that breeding for color is
as absurd as it is impractical, but we can assure these honest
doubters that we have blazed a trail, and all they now have to do
is simply to follow instructions and success will crown their
efforts.</p>
<p>We will enumerate the following colors in the order of their
resistance, so to speak:</p>
<p>No. 1. White. This color, theoretically a combination of red,
green and violet will be found the hardest to eliminate, as the
shade desired will have to be worked in, so to speak, and it will
take several generations before a seal brindle with perfect
markings that can be depended upon to always reproduce itself can
be obtained. Starting with a white bitch (always remember that the
shades desired must be possessed by the dog), we breed her always
to a golden brindle dog. The bitches (those most resembling the
sire in color being selected) from these two are mated to a dark
mahogany brindle dog, and the females from this last union are
mated to a dark seal brindle dog. It will readily be observed that
we have bred into the white color, golden, mahogany and seal
brindle and this admixture of color will give practically over
ninety per cent. of desirable brindles. Always see that the sires
used are perfectly marked, from ancestry possessing the same
correct markings. This is absolutely imperative, where the stock to
be improved is worked upon is white.</p>
<p>No. 2. Black. This color is the opposite of white, inasmuch as
there is an excess of pigment, which in this case will have to be
worked out. Breed the black bitch to a red brindle dog (with the
same conditions regarding his ancestry). The females from these
matings bred always to a dark mahogany brindle dog. The females
from the last matings breed to a medium seal brindle dog with a
very glossy coat, and the result of these last matings will be good
seal brindles. If any bitches should occasionally come black, breed
always to a golden brindle dog. No other shade will do the
trick.</p>
<p>No. 3. Gray brindle. This is practically a dead color, but easy
to work out. Breed first to a golden brindle dog. The females from
this union breed to a rich mahogany brindle, and the bitches from
this last litter breed to a seal brindle dog.</p>
<p>No. 4. Buckskin. Breed bitch to golden brindle dog; the females
from this union to a red brindle dog (if unobtainable, use mahogany
brindle dog, but this is not so effective), and the females from
last union breed to a seal brindle dog.</p>
<p>No. 5. Liver. This is a great deal like the last, but a little
harder to manipulate. Breed first to a golden brindle dog. The
females from this union breed to a seal brindle. The bitches from
this union breed to mahogany brindle dog with black bars running
through the coat, and the females from last mating breed to seal
brindles.</p>
<p>No. 6. Mouse color. Use same process as for gray brindles.</p>
<p>No. 7. Yellow. A very undesirable shade, but easy to eliminate.
Breed to mahogany brindle dog as dark as can be obtained, and
bitches from this mating breed to a seal brindle dog.</p>
<p>No. 8. Steel and tiger brindles I class together, as the process
is the same and results are easy. Breed first to a red brindle dog;
bitches from this union to a dark mahogany brindle, and then use
seal brindle dog on bitch from last mating.</p>
<p>No. 9. Red brindle. No skill is required here. Breed first to
mahogany brindles, and bitches from this union to seal
brindles.</p>
<p>We have now enumerated practically all the less desirable
shades, but let me observe in passing, in the process of color
breeding that the law of atavism, or &ldquo;throwing back,&rdquo;
often asserts itself, and we shall see colors belonging to a
far-off ancestry occasionally presenting themselves in all these
matings. Once in a while a dog will be found that no matter what
color bitches he may be mated with, he will mark a certain number
of the litter with the peculiar color or markings of some remote
ancestor. Just a case apropos of this will suffice. We used in our
kennels a dog of perfect markings, coming from an immediate
ancestry of perfectly marked dogs, and mated him with quite a
number of absolutely perfectly marked bitches that we had bred for
a great number of years that had before that had perfectly marked
pups, and every bitch, no matter how bred, had over fifty per cent.
of white headed pups. We saw the pups in other places sired by this
dog, no matter where bred, similarly marked. We found his
grandmother was a white headed dog, and this dog inherited this
feature in his blood, and passed it on to posterity. The minute a
stud dog, perfect in himself, is prepotent to impress upon his
offspring a defect in his ancestry, discard him at once. I have
often been amused to see how frequently this law of atavism is
either misunderstood or ignored. Only recently I have seen a number
of letters in a leading dog magazine, in which several people who
apparently ought to know better, were accusing litters of bulldog
pups as being of impure blood because there were one or two black
pups amongst them. They must, of course, have been conversant with
the fact that bulldogs years ago frequently came of that color, and
failed to reason that in consequence of this, pups of that shade
are liable once in a while to occur. It is always a safe rule in
color breeding to discard as a stud a dog, no matter how brilliant
his coat may be, who persistently sires pups whose colors are
indistinct and run together, as it were.</p>

<p>Remember, in closing this chapter, that as &ldquo;eternal
vigilance is the price of liberty,&rdquo; so the eternal admixtures
of colors is the price of rich brindles. If one has the time the
works of an Austrian monk named Mendel are of great interest as
bearing somewhat on this subject, and the two English naturalists,
Messrs. Everett and J. G. Millais, whose writings contain the
result of extensive scientific experiments on dogs and game birds,
are of absorbing interest also.</p>

<h2>SALES.</h2>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>Every person who has bred Bostons for any length of time knows
that a good dog sells himself. I do not imagine there is
practically any part of this great country where a typical dog, of
proper color and markings and all right in every respect, fails to
meet a prospective buyer, and yet, of course, there are certain
places where an A 1 dog, like an ideal saddle or carriage horse
meets with a readier sale, at a far greater price than others. New
York city, in particular, and all the larger cities of the country
where there are large accumulations of wealth, offer the best
markets for the greatest numbers of this aristocratic member of the
dog fraternity, and from my own personal knowledge the larger
cities of the countries adjacent to the United States furnish
nearly as good a market, at a somewhat reduced price. Were the
quarantines removed in the mother country, which England no doubt
has found absolutely necessary, it would not surprise me in the
least to see an unprecedented demand for the Boston at very high
prices, and I am going to make a prediction that on the continent
of Europe it will not be long before the American dog will follow
the trotting horse, and will work his way eastward, until jealous
China and strange Japan will be as enamoured with him as we are,
and his devotees at the Antipodes will be wondering where he got
his little screw tail, and why that sweet, serene expression on his
face, like the &ldquo;Quaker Oat smile,&rdquo; never comes off.
This to a person who knows not the Boston may seem extravagant
praise, but to all such we simply say: Get one, and then see if you
are not ready to exclaim with the Queen of Sheba, when visiting
King Solomon and being shown his treasures: &ldquo;Behold, the half
was not told me!&rdquo; Perhaps the system of sales that has always
been followed by us may be of interest to many engaged in the
breeding of the dog, and while we do not hold a patent on the same,
or even suggest its adoption by others, must confess it has worked
with entire satisfaction in our case, and we have never once failed
to receive the purchase money. We must say in explanation that our
customers practically are all bankers and brokers, and that our
dogs have never been sold by advertising or being exhibited at
shows, but by being recommended by one man to another, starting
many years ago by the first sale to a Boston banker, then to
several members of his firm, going from Boston to their
correspondents in other cities, until the orders come in from
everywhere. We had three orders from as many countries in one mail
last week. I merely mention this to show how the demand for the dog
has grown. When we commenced to sell dogs we adopted the following
plan, which we conceived to be just and equitable alike to buyer
and seller: When a dog is ordered we send on one which we believe
will fill the bill, accurately describing the dog, stating age,
pedigree, etc., and stating that when the customer is perfectly
satisfied with the dog (as long a trial being given as may be
wished) in every respect, a check will be accepted, and not before.
Should the dog at any time prove unsatisfactory in any way, the
purchase money will be cheerfully refunded, or a dog of equal value
will be sent in exchange. In the case of a bitch that fails to
become a good breeder, the same plan, of course, is followed. In
regard to the sale of puppies, we guarantee them (barring
accidents, and the showing of them, when owner assumes risks) to
reach maturity, and in case they do not, refund purchase money, or
send on another puppy of equal value.</p>
<p>Of course, where the buyer is not known, or personally
recommended, then the seller has to adopt entirely different
methods. Still, I see no reason why an honest man who has a Boston,
or any other dog, for sale, or, in fact, any article of
merchandise, should not be willing to send on the same to any
honest buyer. This is on the assumption, of course, that both
parties are honorable men. To the seller I advise the purchase
money being received before the dog is shipped, and express charges
guaranteed, if the buyer is not known or unable to supply
absolutely reliable references. Decline to receive any order where
the object sought is to obtain a dog to use to breed to a bitch, or
several, as the case may be, and then be returned as
unsatisfactory. We have had no experience in this line, but are
informed it has frequently been done. If such a customer presents
himself, simply tell him he can inspect the dog or have an expert
do so for him if too far away to come, but that when the deal is
closed and the money paid that under no conditions whatever can the
dog be returned. In regard to the seller shipping the dog to its
destination, we will say that we think he will run practically no
risk in so doing. If the dog is all right in every way it is
dollars to doughnuts that he will arrive in perfect condition. We
can say that in over twenty years&rsquo; shipments of dogs to all
parts of the country and beyond we have never had a dog die en
route, lost, exchanged, or stolen. I think the express companies of
this country, Canada, Mexico, and beyond, are to be highly
commended for the excellent care they take of the dogs committed to
their charge, neither do I think the express charges are ever
excessive, when one considers the value of the dogs carried.</p>
<p>We will now consider the case of the buyer, assuming, of course,
he is known or capable of presenting suitable references. We always
advise him to deal with kennels or dealers of established
reputations. Run no chances with any other unless you desire to be
&ldquo;trimmed.&rdquo; Pray do not be misled by glowing
advertisements (stating that they have the largest kennels on
earth) in every paper that does not know them. I have investigated
quite a number of these so-called kennels and found they usually
consisted of an old box stall in a cheap stable, or a room over an
equally cheap barroom, and their stock in trade consisted of two or
three mutts.</p>
<p>Be very suspicious of any man who advertises that he has dogs
for sale that can win in fast company for fifty or a hundred
dollars, or A 1 bitches in whelp to noted dogs for the same price.
Any man who possesses these kinds of dogs does not have to
advertise their sale. There are plenty of people here in Boston
only too glad to buy this kind of stock at three or four times this
price.</p>
<p>I attended the last show in Boston with a number of orders in my
pocket, but failed to discover any dogs I picked out possessing the
quality described at anything less than a good stiff price, for
Boston terriers with the &ldquo;hall mark&rdquo; of quality have
been, are, and, I believe, always will be, as staple in value as
diamonds.</p>
<p>The number of letters we have received from all over the
country, particularly from the West, complaining of the skin games
played upon them by fake kennels and dealers, would make an angel
weep, and make one almost regret that one ever knew a Boston. If
the same ingenuity, skill and patience employed in the getting up
of these fake advertisements had been devoted to the breeding of
the dog, this class of advertising gentry (?) would have produced
something fit to sell. It is stated on the best of authority that
in some cases nothing was shipped for money received.</p>
<p>In spite of this vast number of unscrupulous breeders and
dealers scattered abroad, I think the chances for reliable kennels
was never so good as now in the history of the breed. Cream will
always rise, and right dealing, whether in dogs or diamonds, will
ever meet with their just returns. Remember that one never forgets
being &ldquo;taken in&rdquo; in a horse trade, and when, instead of
a horse a dog is involved, I think one never forgives as well. To
that number of persons who, in their daily walks of life are fairly
honest, but who, when it comes to a trade in dogs are apt to lose
that fine sense of justice that should characterize all
transactions, we would say with Shakespeare: &ldquo;To thine own
self be true. Thou canst not then be false to any man.&rdquo; Yea,
we would repeat the command of a greater than Shakespeare, to whom,
I trust, we all pay reverence, when He lays down for us all the
Golden Rule: &ldquo;Whatsoever ye would that men would do to you,
do ye even so to them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To go back to the responsible buyer who is in the market for a
good dog, we say: Send your orders to responsible men, with said
dogs to sell, stating exactly what you want, and the price you
desire to pay, agreeing to send a check just as soon as dogs prove
satisfactory, assuming, of course, express charges. Reputable
dealers and breeders are looking for just such customers.</p>
<p>To all breeders and dealers who have not an established
reputation, would say: Advertise accurately what you have for sale
in first class reliable papers and magazines. In regard to prices,
the following scale, adopted by us many years ago, and which we
have never seen since any reason to change, is practically as
follows:</p>
<p>For pups from two to three months old, from fifty to
seventy-five dollars. When six months old, from seventy-five to a
hundred: From six months to maturity, from one hundred to two
hundred. These prices are, of course, for the ordinary all-around
good dogs. With dogs that approximate perfection, and which only
come in the same proportion as giants and dwarfs do in the human
race (I believe the proportion is one in five thousand), and the
advent of which would surprise the average kennel man as much as if
the President had sent him a special invitation to dine with him at
the White House, the price is problematical, and is negotiated
solely by the demand for such a wonder by a comparatively few
buyers.</p>
<p>I think Boston terriers as a breed occupy the same position
amongst dogs as the hunter and carriage horse does amongst horses.
Each are more or less a luxury. A well matched pair of horses of
good all-round action, of desirable color and perfect manners and
suitable age will sell in the Eastern cities (I am not sufficiently
acquainted with the other sections of the country to know values
there) at from eight hundred to two thousand dollars, but with a
pair of carriage horses able to win on the tan bark, the price will
be regulated by the comparatively few people who have sufficient
money to spare to purchase this fashionable luxury, and ten times
the amount paid for the first mentioned pair would be a reasonable
price to pay for the prize winners. I think the winners of the blue
in the Bostons would fetch a relative sum.</p>
<p>The important factor of the cost of production in the case of
the dog necessarily enters into the selling price. Good Bostons are
as hard to raise as first class hunters, and a correspondingly
large sum has to be obtained to meet expenses, to say nothing of
profit, but in the writer&rsquo;s experience the best dog or horse
sells the readiest. Do not be misled by the remark &ldquo;that a
dog is worth all he will bring.&rdquo; Generally speaking, this is
sound logic, but not always. Many dogs have been sold for very
little by people not cognizant of their value, but this in no way
changed the intrinsic worth of the dog. On the other hand, many
dogs have been disposed of at many times their real value, but this
transaction did not enhance their worth in the slightest degree. A
gold dollar is worth one hundred cents whether changed for fifty
cents or five hundred. An article of intrinsic value never changes.
Our advice to all who have dogs for sale (or any other article, in
fact), ask what you know is a good, honest, fair value, and
although you may not sell the dog today, remember that there are
other days to follow. What I am going to add now I know a great
many dealers and breeders will laugh at and declare me a fit
subject for an alienist to work on, but it is fundamentally true
just the same, and is this: Never ask or take for a dog more than
you know (not guess) the dog is worth. This is nothing but
ordinary, common everyday justice that every man has every right to
demand of his fellow man, and every man that is a gentleman will
recognize the truth and force of.</p>
<p>I was reading a novel this summer, and one statement amongst a
great many good ones impressed me. It stated &ldquo;that all men
were divided into two classes: those that behaved themselves, and
those who did not.&rdquo; We all know that society has divided men
into many classes, but I think any thoughtful man will confess, in
the last analysis, that the novelist&rsquo;s classification was the
correct one. I need not apply the moral.</p>
<p>It will be somewhat of a temptation to resist taking what a
party, liberally supplied with this world&rsquo;s goods, will
frequently in their ignorance offer for a dog that appeals to them,
but which the owner knows perfectly well is not worth the price
offered. If he belongs to the class that behaves themselves he will
tell the prospective buyer what the dog is intrinsically worth, and
point out the reasons why he is not worth more. You may depend that
you have not only obtained a customer for life, but one that will
readily advertise your kennels under all circumstances. I shall
have to ask the reader to overlook the apparent egotism of the
statements I am now about to make, but as this book is largely the
outgrowth of the author&rsquo;s own experience, of necessity
personal matters are spoken of.</p>
<p>A number of years ago I received an order from the Western
coast, through a Boston house, for a good all-round puppy at two
hundred dollars. I sent the puppy on, and much to the surprise of
the customer, stated my price for him would be one hundred instead
of two. The pup matured into a very nice dog, as I expected he
would, being a Cracksman pup out of a good bitch. What has been the
result of this treatment? Ever since (and no later than yesterday),
orders for dogs from this gentleman have been coming right
along.</p>
<p>Another case, and this is only a sample of several from the same
city: A number of years back a New York lady, accompanied by her
husband, came to our kennels to purchase a dog. I had quite a
handsome litter of five or six months old pups by &ldquo;Merk
Jr.,&rdquo; out of Buster stock on the dam&rsquo;s side, one of
which, a perfectly marked seal brindle female, at once took her
fancy, and she said: &ldquo;We have just come from another large
kennel in Boston where they asked us three hundred dollars for a
little female I do not like nearly as well as this one.&rdquo; Her
husband was one of the leading men of one of the largest trusts in
the country, and money was apparently no object, and when I
replied, &ldquo;Mrs. Keller, that dog you select is not worth over
fifty dollars (the price I afterwards sold her for) and the best
dog in the litter I shall be glad to let you have for
seventy-five,&rdquo; she seemed much surprised. I then, of course,
told her that the dogs were not worth more as their muzzles were
not deep enough to be worth a higher price than I wanted. I
recently received a letter from her stating that her dog was still
as active and much loved as ever, and the number of orders that
have come to me through the sale of this dog would surprise the
owners of those kennels who stick their customers with an
outrageous price, and who find to their sorrow that no subsequent
orders ever come, either from the customer or any one else in the
vicinity. People have a way sooner or later (usually sooner) in
discovering when they have been overcharged and act
accordingly.</p>
<p>One other recommendation I wish to make in place here is:
&ldquo;Never try to fill an order that one has not the dogs to
suit.&rdquo; Frankly say so, and recommend a brother fancier that
you know has. One good turn deserves another and he may have a
chance later to reciprocate. This creates a kindly feeling amongst
kennel men, and is productive of good will, and ofttimes a large
increase in business. A few years ago a lady from Connecticut came
to see me to buy a first class dog or a pair, if she could get
suited. I knew that in the past she had paid the highest price for
her Bostons, and she wanted a dog in the neighborhood of two
thousand dollars. I told her at once I had nothing for sale to suit
her, but that I knew a man who owned a dog I considered worth about
that sum, and recommended her strongly to buy him, and sent her to
Mr. Keady, who sold to her &ldquo;Gordon Boy&rdquo; for that price.
The sequel to this is somewhat amusing and shows how reciprocity
did not take place. I went to see a litter of pups at Mr.
Keady&rsquo;s house soon after, and expected to obtain a somewhat
favorable price on the pup I picked out of the litter on account of
the sale of the dog, and offered the gentleman three hundred
dollars for him, upon which he replied: &ldquo;Mr. Axtell, do you
think that five weeks old pup is worth that sum?&rdquo; and upon my
replying, &ldquo;I certainly do,&rdquo; instead of saying,
&ldquo;All right, take him,&rdquo; he exclaimed: &ldquo;If that is
your opinion, and I know you always say what you believe, then he
is worth that sum to me,&rdquo; and put him back in the box. He
subsequently sold him to Mr. Borden for over six thousand dollars,
the highest price ever obtained for a Boston.</p>
<p>While writing on the subject of sales, I think it will be in
order to speak of a matter that is a source of anxiety to a great
many breeders, and that is the getting rid of the small bitches
that are too small to breed. We have always found a ready sale for
these when properly spayed for ladies&rsquo; pets, largely in New
York city. They make ideal house dogs, perhaps more winning and
affectionate in their manner than others, never wandering off, and
I believe the license fee is the same as for a male. Great care
must be taken that the operation is thoroughly performed by a
competent veterinary, and it is usually best done when the pup is
six months old. My first experience may be of value and interest. I
had a little &ldquo;Buster&rdquo; bitch that I felt assured to my
sorrow was to small to whelp successfully, and being much fancied
by a lady doctor in Waterbury, Conn., advised spaying before being
sent. I took her to a veterinary with a good reputation in Boston,
and after the dog had fully recovered from the operation, sent her
to Dr. Conky. What was my surprise to hear that when nine months
old she had come &ldquo;in season.&rdquo; I sent the ex-President
of the Boston Terrier Club, Dr. Osgood, down and an additional cost
of fifty dollars ensued, whereas the first charge of two dollars
would have been all that was necessary if the operation had been
properly done in the first place. Am glad to say I have seen no
failures since. I can conceive of no reason why there should not be
a ready sale for this class of dogs in all sections of the country,
and the disposal of the same will materially help the income of a
great many breeders.</p>
<p>In conclusion let me state: &ldquo;Put a price on your dogs that
in your best judgment you know (not guess) to be a fair and
equitable one (and if unable to decide what is right, call in an
honorable expert who can) and take neither more nor less. Always
remember that a man can raise horses, corn, cotton, or dogs (or any
other honest product) and be a gentleman, but the moment he raises
'Cain' he ceases to be one.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>BOSTON TERRIER TYPE AND THE STANDARD.</h2>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>The standard adopted by the Boston Terrier Club in 1900 was the
result of earnest, sincere, thoughtful deliberations of as
conservative and conscientious a body of men as could anywhere be
gotten together. Nothing was done in haste, the utmost
consideration was given to every detail, and it was a thoroughly
matured, and practically infallible guide to the general character
and type of the breed by men who were genuine lovers of the dog for
its own sake, who were perfectly familiar with the breed from its
start, and who were cognizant of every point and characteristic
which differentiated him from the bulldog on the one side and the
bull terrier on the other, and while admitting the just claims of
every other breed, believed sincerely that the dog evolved under
their fostering care was the peer, if not the superior, of all in
the particular sphere for which he was designed, an all-round house
dog and companion. In the writer&rsquo;s estimation this type of
dog, for the particular position in life, so to speak, he is to
occupy, could not in any way be improved, and the mental qualities
that accompany the physical characteristics (which are particularly
specified in the first chapter) are of such inestimable value that
any possible change would be detrimental. It may be observed that
it was the dogs of this type that have led the van everywhere in
the days when he was practically unknown outside of the state in
which he originated. &ldquo;Monte,&rdquo; &ldquo;Druid
Vixon,&rdquo; &ldquo;Bonnie,&rdquo; &ldquo;Revilo Peach,&rdquo; and
dogs of their conformation possessed a type of interesting
individuality that blazed the way east, west, north and south. Does
any one imagine that the so-called terrier type one so often hears
of, and which a large number of people are apparently led today to
believe to be &ldquo;par excellence,&rdquo; the correct thing,
would have been capable of so doing? No one realizes more fully
than the writer the fact that the bully type can be carried too
far, and great harm will inevitably ensue, but the swing of the
pendulum to the exaggerated terrier type will in time, I firmly
believe, ring in his death knell. It is a source of wonderment to
me that numbers of men who don the ermine can distribute prizes to
the weedy specimens, shallow in muzzle, light in bone and
substance, long in body, head and tail, who adorn (?) the shows of
the past few years. I am not a prophet, neither the son of one, but
I will hazard my reputation in predicting that before many years
have rolled, a type, approximating that authorized by the Boston
Terrier Club in 1900 will prevail, and the friends of the dog will
undoubtedly believe it to be good enough to last for all time.</p>
<p>It will readily be recalled that Lord Byron said of the eminent
actor, Sheridan, &ldquo;that nature broke the die in moulding one
such man,&rdquo; and the same may be affirmed with equal truth of
the Boston terrier, and he will ever remain a type superior to and
differ from all other breeds in his particular sphere.</p>
<p>It may not be generally known by those who are insisting on a
much more terrier conformation than the standard calls for, that an
equally extreme desire for an exaggerated bull type prevailed a
number of years ago amongst some of the dogs&rsquo; warmest
supporters, whose ideal was that practically of a miniature
bulldog, without the pronounced contour of the same. I remember
when I joined the Club in the early days that some of the members
then were afraid that the dogs were approximating too much to the
terrier side of the house. What their views today would be I leave
the reader to imagine. The plain fact of the case is, the dog
should be a happy medium between the two, the bull and the terrier.
Can any intelligent man find a chance for improvement here? I admit
that many people are so constituted that a change is necessary in
practically everything they are brought into close contact with.
But is a change necessarily an improvement? If some men could
change the color of their eyes or the general contour of their
features they would never rest satisfied until they had so done,
but they would speedily find out that such a change would be very
detrimental to their appearance, the harmony of features and
correlation of one part to another would be distorted. I admit
readily that one very important result would be obtained, viz., the
dog of the pronounced terrier type could be bred much more easily.
But is an easy production a desideratum? I certainly think not. To
those who &ldquo;must be doing something&rdquo; and who find a
certain sense of satisfaction in tinkering with the standard, we
extend our pity, and state that experience is a hard school, but
some people will learn in no other. To those of us who love the dog
as he is, and who believe in &ldquo;letting well enough
alone,&rdquo; we admit we might as well suggest to improve the
majestic proportions of the old world cathedrals and castles we all
love so much to see, or advocate the lightening up of the shadows
on the canvas of the old masters, or recommend the touching up of
the immortal carvings of the Italian sculptors. We advise the
preacher to stick to his text, and the shoemaker to his last, and
to all those who would improve the standard we say: Hands off! One
very important feature in connection with the Standard is, that
while breeders and judges are perfectly willing to have all dogs
that come in the heavyweight class conform practically to it, when
the lightweights and toys are concerned, a somewhat different type
is permitted and the so-called terrier type is allowed, hence we
see a tendency with the smaller dogs to a narrower chest, longer
face and tail. While personally I am in favor of a dog weighing
from sixteen to twenty pounds, or even somewhat heavier, there is
absolutely no reason why one should not have any sized dog one
desires, but please observe, do not breed small dogs at the expense
of the type. Let the ten or twelve pound dog conform to the
standard as much as if it weighed twenty. I think an object lesson
will be of inestimable value here. Every one who has visited the
poultry shows of the past few years must have been delighted and
impressed to see the beautiful varieties of bantams. Take the
games, for example, with their magnificent plumage and sprightly
bearing. On even a casual examination it will be discovered that
these little fowls are an exact reproduction of the game fowl in
miniature. The same identical proportions, symmetry and shape. Take
the lordly Brahma and the bantam bearing the same name, and the
same exact proportions prevail. And so it should be with the small
Boston terrier. They should possess the same proportions and
symmetry as the larger. Remember always that when the dog is bred
too much away from the bulldog type, a great loss in the loving
disposition of the dog is bound to ensue. Personally, if the type
had to be changed, I would rather lean to the bull type than the
terrier. The following testimony of a Boston banker and director of
the Union Pacific Railroad, to whom I sold two large dogs that were
decidedly on the bull type, may be of interest at this point.
Speaking of the first dog he said: &ldquo;I have had all kinds of
dogs, but I get more genuine pleasure out of my Boston terrier than
all my other dogs combined. When I reach home in the afternoon I am
met at the gate by Prince, and when I sit down to read my paper or
a book the dog is at my feet on the rug, staying there perfectly
still as long as I do. When dinner is announced he goes with me to
the dining room, takes his place by my side, and every little while
licks my hands, and when I go out for my usual walk before retiring
the dog is waiting for me at the door while I put my hat and coat
on. He follows me, never running away or barking, and he sleeps on
a mat outside my door at night, and I never worry about
burglars.&rdquo; All this is very simple and commonplace, but it
shows why this type of a dog is liked. In regard to the differences
of opinion that different judges exhibit when passing upon a dog in
the show room, one preferring one type of a dog and the other
another, this, of course, is morally wrong. The standard
requirements should govern, and not individual preferences. We hear
a good deal said nowadays about the cleaning up of the head, and
the so-called terrier finish. That seems to be the thing to do, but
does not the standard call for a compactly built dog, finished in
every part of his make-up, and possessing style and a graceful
carriage? This being the case, a dog should not possess wrinkled,
loose skin on head or neck, and the shoulders should be neat and
trim. In a word, in comporting to the standard a dog is produced
that possesses a harmonious whole, &ldquo;a thing of beauty&rdquo;
and a joy as long as he lives. In short, the dog should be as far
removed from the bull type as he is from the terrier. If the
present judges can not see their way clear to follow the standard,
why, appoint those that will, for as every fair minded man agrees,
the dogs should follow the standard and not the standard follow the
dogs. It is needless to add that I do not share in the pessimistic
view taken by many lovers of the dog who think he will be
permanently injured by the differences of opinion that prevail as
to the type, etc., and the personalities that sometimes mar the
showing of the dog, for I am of the same opinion as was probably
felt by the great fish who had to give up Jonah, &ldquo;that it is
an impossible feat to keep a good man (or dog) down,&rdquo; and
that instead of falling off, as one writer intimates, he will fall
into the good graces of a larger number of people than has
heretofore fallen to the lot of any variety of man&rsquo;s best
friend.</p>

<h2>PICTURE TAKING.</h2>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>It would seem at the first glance that to write on this subject
was only a waste of time and energy, and yet I know that no one
feature of the dog business is more vital in importance or more
fraught with trouble than this apparently simple process of dog
photography.</p>
<p>The novice will at once exclaim: &ldquo;What could be more
natural than sending on a picture of a dog I want to sell to the
prospective customer? Surely he can see exactly what he is
purchasing!&rdquo; This may be perfectly true, and yet again it may
not.</p>
<p>I am not writing of the subject of false pictures on the stud
cards of some unscrupulous breeders, or those pictures taken of
dogs whose markings are faked, only too common in some quarters.
The photos look good, of course, to the buyer, but when the dog
arrives, he finds, to his disgust, that the beautiful markings, in
some mysterious manner, got &ldquo;rubbed off&rdquo; while making
the journey in the crate. I recently saw a photograph of a dog sold
to a Western customer, by a dealer in an adjoining town to mine,
taken by an artist in photography when the dog was all
&ldquo;chalked up&rdquo;. When the dog arrived he was as free from
nose band as my pocket is frequently of a dollar bill. Small wonder
the buyer remarked with emphasis that the dealer was a fraud. One
can almost forgive his exclamation, which he surely had not learned
at Sunday school, at being taken in, in so mean a way.</p>
<p>I am writing more particularly of the art of the photographer in
bringing out the best points of the dog, and effectually hiding the
poorer ones. How many times have we heard the dealer say, in
speaking of a dog with good markings, but off in many other
respects: &ldquo;He will make a good seller to ship away, as I can
get a good looking picture of him.&rdquo; He knows perfectly well
that a clever photographer can so pose the dog as to hide bad
defects. A long muzzle, a long back, or one badly roached, poor
tail, bad legs and feet, can all be minimized by posing the dog on
the stand. The buyer, on receipt of the dog, although thoroughly
dissatisfied, will have to admit that the photo is a genuine one,
and, in most cases, is unable to obtain any redress.</p>
<p>Another very important side of dog photography is the mania for
picture collecting. Some time ago I saw a signed article in
&ldquo;Dogdom&rdquo;, from a very charming lady living in a city
fifty miles from Boston, asserting she was about to retire from the
Boston terrier game, as it cost her too much to furnish photos of
her dogs to people from all parts of the country, who, under the
guise of wishing to buy dogs, wanted photos and pedigrees of the
same. They usually stated that if they did not purchase the dog,
the photo and pedigree would be promptly returned. This was the
last she ever heard of them, and pictures were rarely if ever,
returned. As her photos were taken by a first class photographer,
the cost was considerable, and the photos were really works of art,
which, perhaps, may be one reason why the recipients could not bear
to let them go back. She was a lady of large wealth, and she had
established a kennel of real Bostons, presided over by an expert
kennel-maid, and would have become a genuine help to the breed, but
&ldquo;pictures&rdquo; were her undoing.</p>
<p>Since the American dog has become the most popular breed in the
canine world, many people, who cannot afford to purchase a choice
specimen, seem to rest satisfied when they can obtain a photo, and
they have no scruples apparently in writing to the leading kennels
for pictures of their leading dogs. I have had many instances come
under my notice, but, for want of space, only one typical case can
be mentioned.</p>
<p>A few years ago, on visiting a city a short distance from
Boston, I was accosted by a young man, rather flashily attired, who
invited me to call and see his kennels, assuring me he had some
crackerjacks. As I was unaware of the existence of any number of
A-1 Bostons in his neighborhood, my curiosity was aroused and I
went. I found the dogs quartered in a back room in a very small
house. I have never seen such a collection of the aristocrats of
the breed before or since.</p>
<p>When I found my voice, I managed to exclaim: &ldquo;Allow me to
congratulate you, my dear sir, I have never seen so many good dogs
kenneled in so small a space before. You are certainly a very lucky
man; the food problem never troubles you; you do not have to dodge
the tax collector; no need ever to call in a vet.; no neighbors can
ever complain of being kept awake at night, and the dogs that are
tacked upon the ceiling seem just as content as those pasted on the
walls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He then produced his book where the pedigrees of the dogs were
neatly recorded. The trouble is, he is not the only one who owns
such a kennel of thorough-breds.</p>
<p>It must not be inferred from the above that I am averse to
picture taking. By no means. They are absolutely necessary. But
make them &ldquo;Pen Pictures&rdquo;. Write a complete description
of the dog in question, giving actual weight, age, conformation,
color and markings, condition of health, and disposition. State the
color of the brindle and the extent of the markings whether full or
partial. Do not state that the dog has perfect markings if it lacks
a collar or white feet. If banded only on one side of the muzzle,
say so. If pinched or undershot, say so. If roached in back, poor
eyes, weak in hind quarters or off in tail, say so. In fact,
plainly state any defects. At the same time, if the dog is
practically O. K. in all respects, stylish and trappy, do not
hesitate to emphasize the fact, and if the dog likewise possesses a
charming, delightful personality, make the most of it. Always
remember that the perfect Boston terrier dies young!</p>

<h2>NOTES.</h2>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>There are several features of vital import in Boston terrier
breeding that the passing years have disclosed to the writer the
imperative need of attention to. Most of these have been spoken of
in this book before, but they seem to me at the present time to
demand being specially emphasized. Feeding and its relation to skin
diseases, I think, naturally heads the list.</p>
<p>I have received more letters of inquiry from all parts of the
country asking what to do for skin trouble than for all other
ailments combined. I think our little dog is more susceptible to
skin affections than most dogs, owing to the fact that he is more
or less a house pet, and does not get the chance of as much outdoor
exercise, and the access to nature&rsquo;s remedy&mdash;grass, as
most breeds. At the same time if fed properly, given sufficient
life in the open, no dog possesses a more beautiful glossy
coat.</p>
<p>No one factor is more responsible for skin trouble than the
indiscriminate feeding of dog biscuit. These, as previously
written, are first rate supplementary food, but where they are made
the &ldquo;piece de resistance,&rdquo; look out for breakers ahead.
The mere fact of their being available under all circumstances and
in all places contributes largely to their general use.</p>
<p>At the new million dollar Angell Memorial Animal Hospital,
Boston, Doctors Daly and Flanigan have conducted a series of
scientific experiments on dogs. I had talked with Dr. Flanigan, and
stated my experience was that an exclusive dog biscuit diet was the
cause of skin trouble invariably.</p>
<p>They selected forty dogs in perfect physical condition, dividing
them into two groups of twenty each. To one was fed exclusively dog
biscuits, and the other a diet of milk in the morning, and at night
a feed composed of a liberal amount of spinach&mdash;they had to
use the canned article as it was in winter&mdash;boiled with meat
scraps and thickened with sound stale bread.</p>
<p>At the end of a fortnight seventeen of the first group were
afflicted more or less with skin trouble, while the other twenty
were in the pink of condition. To effect a cure, the spinach
diet&mdash;called by the French &ldquo;the broom of the
stomach&rdquo;&mdash;was fed, and the coat washed with a weak
sulpho-naphtha solution. No internal medicine was given. In a
month&rsquo;s time the coats of the dogs were normal. Further
comment on this is unnecessary.</p>
<p>Next in importance to spinach I place carrots and cabbage,
boiled up with the meat and rice, oat meal and occasionally corn
meal. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to give a good quantity of the sliced
boiled carrots, especially in the winter season when the dogs
cannot obtain grass.</p>
<p>A short time ago, I went to see a group of trained monkeys and
dogs perform. They both looked in beautiful condition, and on
enquiring of the proprietor as to his methods of feeding, he said
it was a very easy matter, as he had trained both dogs and monkeys
to eat raw carrots while on the road, during which time he had to
feed dog biscuits. When at home in New York he fed a vegetable hash
with sound meat and rye bread, using largely carrots, beets, a very
few potatoes and some apples. While on the road he had no
facilities for cooking for his animals so he accustomed them to
eating cut up raw carrots every other day. Previous to this he was
bothered with skin trouble with both dogs and monkeys.</p>

<p>Mrs. William Kuback, with Ch. Lady Sensation</p>
</div>
<p>The food problem at the present time is a very serious one. The
high cost of all sorts of food of every variety should force those
breeders who have been keeping a very inferior stock to make up
their minds once and for all that it takes just as much time and
cost to raise &ldquo;mutts&rdquo; as it does the real article. Weed
out the inferior stock that never did or will pay for their keep.
Keep half a dozen good ones that will reproduce, if bred rightly,
their quality, if you have not plenty of room for a large number.
To those fanciers who only own two or three, sufficient food is
usually furnished from the scraps left from the table,
supplemented, of course, with dog biscuit.</p>
<p>Many kennel-men, who have a large number of dogs to feed, obtain
daily from hotels or boarding houses the table scraps, and this
makes an ideal food. We fed quite a large number of dogs for
several years in this way with perfect success. I know of a large
pack of foxhounds that are fed from the same food furnished by a
large hotel. Fish heads boiled with vegetables make a good
diet&mdash;be sure there are no fish hooks left in them, and the
scraps from the butchers that are not quite fit for human
consumption make ideal food when cooked with rice or vegetables. Be
careful they are not too old, however. When skimmed milk is
obtainable at the right price, with waste stale bread, it makes a
well balanced ration for occasional feeding. A few onions boiled up
with the feed are always in order.</p>
<p>I think the subject of &ldquo;Tails&rdquo; requires more than a
passing mention here. All observers at the recent shows must have
noticed the tendency toward a lengthening in many of the tails of
the dogs on the bench. Some dogs have been awarded high honors
which carried &ldquo;more than the law allows&rdquo;, owing
doubtless to their other excellent qualities. While I personally
believe in a happy medium, never lose sight of the fact that a good
short screw tail has always been, and, I believe, will always
remain a leading characteristic of the American dog.</p>
<p>In selecting a stud dog be certain his tail is O. K. The bitch
can very well afford to carry a longer one, and usually whelps
better on this account. I know of nothing more discouraging in the
Boston terrier game than to have a litter of choice puppies in
every other respect, but off in tails.</p>
<p>While writing on the subject of tails, it may not be out of
place to note an interesting fact in connection with this at the
earliest history of our little dog. Mr. John Barnard became the
possessor of Tom, afterward known as Barnard&rsquo;s Tom. This was
the first Boston terrier to rejoice in a screw tail. Mr. Barnard
did not know what to make of it, so he took the pup to old Dr.
Saunders, a well known and respected veterinary surgeon of the day,
to have the tail, if possible, put into splints and straightened. I
guess there have been quite a number of pups, descendants of Tom,
whose owners would have been only too glad to have had their
straight tails put in splints, if, thereby, it would have been
possible to produce a &ldquo;screw&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I think the subject of sufficient importance to again call the
attention of breeders to the necessity of the extreme care in
breeding seal brindles. The demand started some years ago for very
dark color has placed upon the market many dogs devoid of any
brindle shading. At the last Boston Terrier Club specialty show a
beautiful little dog, almost perfect in every other respect, was
given the gate on account of being practically black.</p>
<p>In my former chapter on Color Breeding, I urged the necessity of
using a red or light mahogany brindle on black stock. If either sex
come black, never use any other color than these to mix in. Enough
said!</p>
<p>One is constantly hearing from all parts of the country of the
prevalence of bitches missing. Where they are bred to over-worked
stud dogs no surprise need be manifested. In case of a
&ldquo;miss&rdquo; have the bitch bred two or three times to the
dog next time. If she misses then, the next time let her run with
the dog for several days. I have written this before, but it will
bear repetition.</p>
<p>Do not acquire the habit of getting rid of the matrons of the
kennel when six or seven years old. Many bitches give birth to
strong pups when eight or nine years old. I write, of course, of
those in strong, vigorous condition, that have always had plenty of
good outdoor exercise.</p>
<p>Remember, there is no spot on this broad land where the Boston
terrier does not make himself thoroughly &ldquo;at home.&rdquo;
What more can one wish?</p>

<h2>CONCLUSION.</h2>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>I was sitting by an open fire the other evening, and there
passed through my mind a review of the breed since I saw a great
many years ago, when the world, to me, was young, a handsome little
lad leading down Beacon street, Boston, two dogs, of a different
type than I had ever seen before, that seemed to have stamped upon
them an individual personality and style. They were not bulldogs,
neither were they bull terriers; breeds with which I had been
familiar all my life; but appeared to be a happy combination of
both. I need hardly say that one was Barnard&rsquo;s Tom, and the
other his litter brother, Atkinson&rsquo;s Toby. Tom was the one
destined to make Boston terrier history, as he was the sire of
Barnard&rsquo;s Mike.</p>
<p>Mr. J. P. Barnard has rightly been called the &ldquo;Father of
the Boston terrier,&rdquo; and he still lives, hale and hearty. May
his last days be his best, and full of good cheer!</p>
<p>I am now rapidly approaching the allotted time for man, but I
venture the assertion that were I to visit any city or even small
town of the United States or Canada, I could see some handsome
little lad or lassie leading one of Barnard&rsquo;s Mike&rsquo;s
sons or daughters. Small wonder he is called the American dog.</p>
<p>The celebrated Dr. Johnson once remarked that few children live
to fulfil the promise of their youth. Our little aristocrat of the
dog world has more than done so. May his shadow never grow
less!</p>
<p>I feel convinced that I ought to take this opportunity to record
my kindly appreciation of the generous expressions of thanks for my
efforts on behalf of the dog. They have come from all parts of the
country, and from all classes of people. Were it in my power I
would gladly reply to each individual writer. This is impossible. I
can only say, &ldquo;I thank you! May God bless us, one and
all!&rdquo;</p>

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days

     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
